1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,299
You guys don't understand.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,338
For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,973
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,649
You serious?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,610
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,095
All you need to know
is in the first kiss.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,136
Absolutely.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,774
For us, kissing's an opening act. . .

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,972
. . .like the comedian
you have to sit through. . .

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,091
. . .before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,332
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,735
It's just that that's not. . .

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,851
. . .why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,298
The problem is, after the concert,
no matter how great the show was. . .

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,896
. . .you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,098
We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,779
. . .just trying to stay awake.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,493
Well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,177
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,089
Are we still talking about sex?

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,492
The One With the Sonogram at the End

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,489
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,811
No, it's good.
It is good.

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,535
It's just that doesn't she seem
a little angry?

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,332
Well, she has issues.

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,299
Does she?

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,890
He's out banging other women
with a club. . .

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,615
. . .while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

29
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,772
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,896
Okay, they have issues like:

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,736
''Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close! '' See?

32
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,500
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,893
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,732
Okay. Yes, it is.

35
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,175
I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age.

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,893
Hi.

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,856
So. . . .

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,699
You look great.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,935
I hate that.

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,730
Sorry.

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,050
Thanks. You look good too.

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,689
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who. . .

43
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,774
. . .stands erect. . . .

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,413
So what's new?
Still a--

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,769
A lesbian?

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,689
You never know.

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,171
How's the family?

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,379
Marty's still totally paranoid.

49
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,298
Carol, why are you here?

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,976
I'm pregnant.

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,295
Pregnant!

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,329
She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,091
This is the Three's Company episode
where's there's a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,891
Then I've already seen this one.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,292
Are you through with that?

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,048
Sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,218
Whose ball of paper is this?

58
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,055
That's mine. I wrote a note to
myself, then I didn't need it.

59
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,296
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

60
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,456
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed-- It's fine.

61
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,416
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,611
We know how cruel parents can be. . .

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,579
. . .about the flatness
of a child's pillow.

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,372
Monica? Hi!

65
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,369
Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,931
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,455
Not in a good way.

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,335
Yeah, calm down.

69
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,892
You don't see Ross getting chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,695
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

71
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,737
You see, he's ''The Prince. ''

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,290
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,248
-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,819
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautiful!

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,613
Oh, God! Oh, God!

76
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,091
No, don't touch that.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,533
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to return it to him.

78
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,691
''Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl. . .

79
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,698
. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your family''

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,932
Now I must return the ring,
without the ring. . .

81
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,978
. . .which makes it so much harder.

82
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,777
Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?

83
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,610
Okay, look.

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,613
When did you have it last?

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
Doy! Probably
right before she lost it.

86
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,900
You don't get
a lot of ''doy'' these days.

87
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,020
I know I had it this morning.

88
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,138
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with. . . .

89
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,699
Dinah?

90
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,099
Oh, don't be mad.

91
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,695
-You didn't!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,090
I gave you one job!

93
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,894
But look how straight
those noodles are.

94
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,099
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

95
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,859
I just can't do it.

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,089
Boys?

97
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,499
We're going in!

98
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,576
Hi.

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,098
That is not a happy ''hi. ''

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,733
Carol's pregnant.

101
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,293
I found it!

102
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,094
Yeah.

103
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,692
Do that for two hours. . .

104
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,494
. . .you might be where I am
right about now.

105
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,532
That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

106
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,135
How do you fit
into this whole thing?

107
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,894
Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

108
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,537
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

109
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,657
Basically, it's totally up to me.

110
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,930
She is so great.
I miss her.

111
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,333
What does she mean by ''involved''?

112
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,974
Presumably, the biggest
part of your job is done.

113
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,608
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .

114
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,175
. . .sonogram thing
with them tomorrow.

115
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,369
What'll you do?

116
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,536
I have no idea.

117
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,295
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

118
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,458
This is still ruined, right?

119
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,891
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to call you.

120
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,298
What's that curry taste?

121
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,895
Curry.

122
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,138
I think they're great.
I really do.

123
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,292
Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,138
They all had a thing for him!

125
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,890
Oh, Mom!

126
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,210
Why is this girl going to call me?

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,692
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, food. . .

128
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,089
. . .or I don't know.

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,938
I told her you had a restaurant.

130
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,252
I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

131
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,218
They don't have to know that.

132
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,370
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,736
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .

134
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,299
. . .easy.

135
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,298
This'll sound unbelievably selfish
on my part. . .

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,492
. . .but did you plan on bringing
up the baby/lesbian thing?

137
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,452
It'd take the heat off of me.

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,089
What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.

139
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,131
They were not playing very well.

140
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,496
I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .

141
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,129
. . .but $40,000 is a lot of money.

142
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,495
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

143
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,734
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,089
Nothing.

145
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,538
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

146
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,977
Don't listen to her!
You've always been independent.

147
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,490
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby. . .

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,692
. . .and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

149
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,132
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles. . . .

150
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,328
There are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

151
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,259
With his museum and
his papers getting published.

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,496
Others are satisfied as they are.

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,295
I'm telling you, these are
the people who never get cancer.

154
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,099
I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God. . .

155
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,173
. . .our little Harmonica
doesn't have that problem.

156
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,374
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

157
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,976
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

158
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,570
Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering. . .

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,738
. . .what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

160
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,578
So here's the deal.

161
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,979
Carol's a lesbian.

162
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,335
She's living with a woman named Susan.

163
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,694
She's pregnant with my child.

164
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,538
And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

165
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,013
And you knew about this?

166
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,212
Your folks are really that bad?

167
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,734
Well, you know, these people are pros.

168
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,329
They know what they do.
They take their time.

169
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,140
They get the job done!

170
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,932
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

171
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,092
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

172
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,776
Must pee!

173
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,252
It's worse when you're twins.

174
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,496
-You're a twin?
-Yeah. We don't speak.

175
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,419
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

176
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,492
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

177
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,493
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

178
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,493
Chandler, you're an only child.
You don't have any of this.

179
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,937
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend. . .

180
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,852
. . .who my parents preferred.

181
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,096
Hit the lights, please.

182
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,013
How long was I in there?

183
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,855
I'm just cleaning up.

184
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,094
Do you need any help?

185
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,059
Okay, sure. Thanks.

186
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,689
Anyway. . . .

187
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,777
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

188
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,619
A little.

189
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,699
A lot.

190
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,289
So, got any advice?

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,492
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

192
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,010
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word ''dumped. ''

193
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,419
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

194
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,494
You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

195
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,012
You know, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

196
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,697
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-G YN.

197
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,935
You've got Carol tomorrow.

198
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,617
When did it get so complicated?

199
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,054
Got me.

200
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,289
Remember when we were
in high school together?

201
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,895
Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .

202
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,449
. . .fall in love, and that'd be it?

203
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,255
Man! I never thought I'd be here.

204
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,935
Me neither.

205
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,931
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

206
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,616
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway. . . .

207
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,376
Hi.

208
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,658
-You remember Susan.
-How could I forget?

209
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,528
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

210
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,174
So we're just waiting for. . .?

211
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,610
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

212
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,697
-She.
-Of course, ''she. ''

213
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,259
Is she familiar with our
special situation?

214
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,212
Yes, and she's very supportive.

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,376
Great! Okay, that's great!

216
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,089
No, I'm. . . .

217
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,290
Thanks.

218
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,658
That opens my cervix.

219
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,656
Barry?

220
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,088
Come on in.

221
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,770
Are you sure?

222
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,053
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

223
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,338
So how are you doing?

224
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,290
I'm. . . .

225
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,099
I'm okay.

226
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,415
You look great.

227
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,929
Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.

228
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,899
Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.

229
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,576
I dumped him.

230
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,933
So how's this going to work. . .

231
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,939
. . .you know, with us?

232
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,978
You know, when important
decisions have to be made?

233
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,614
Give me a ''for instance. ''

234
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,492
Well, I don't know.

235
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,010
-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon. . .

236
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,688
. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.

237
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,099
As in ''Mouse''?

238
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,059
As in my grandmother.

239
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,812
Still, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse. ''

240
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,378
How about. . . .

241
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,333
How about ''Julia''?

242
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,169
Julia.

243
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,495
We agreed on Minnie.

244
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,340
We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

245
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,094
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

246
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,611
I believe Julia's on the table.

247
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,899
Sorry about that.

248
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,335
So what have you been up to?

249
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,934
Not much.

250
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,529
I got a job.

251
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,889
That's great!

252
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,533
Why are you so tan?

253
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,169
I went to Aruba.

254
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,099
Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?

255
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,489
No.

256
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,498
See, I went with. . . .

257
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,538
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

258
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,649
I went with Mindy.

259
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,495
Mindy?

260
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,808
My maid of honor?

261
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,692
We're kind of a thing now.

262
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,972
You got plugs!

263
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,979
Careful, careful. They
haven't quite taken yet.

264
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,138
And you got lenses.

265
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,699
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

266
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,293
Not for her.

267
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,410
Listen, I really
wanted to thank you.

268
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,211
A month ago,
I wanted to hurt you. . .

269
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,889
. . .more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

270
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,414
And I'm an orthodontist.

271
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,213
You know, you were right.

272
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,098
I thought we were happy.

273
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,455
We weren't.

274
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,937
But with Mindy. . .

275
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,298
. . .now I'm happy.

276
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,729
-Spit.
-What?

277
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,816
Me.

278
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,699
Anyway. . . .

279
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,737
I guess this belongs to you.

280
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,095
And thank you for giving it to me.

281
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,135
Well, thank you for giving it back.

282
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,893
Hello!

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,331
Oh, please!
What's wrong with Helen?

284
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,575
Helen Geller?

285
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,969
l don't think so!

286
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,211
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

287
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,489
Thank you.

288
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,571
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

289
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,779
It'll be Helen Willick?

290
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,933
Actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

291
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,140
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

292
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,659
It's my baby too.

293
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,974
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

294
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,094
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

295
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,213
You two, stop it!

296
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,496
She gets a credit!
I'm in there too!

297
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,210
Not Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
I think that borders on child abuse.

298
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,049
Of course not!
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

299
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,178
He knows no one will
say all those names.

300
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,736
They'll end up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

301
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,291
My way?
You think this is my way?

302
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,010
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being. . .

303
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,730
. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

304
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,540
Knock, knock!
How are we today? Any nausea?

305
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,571
-A little.
-Just a little.

306
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,890
I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

307
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,936
Lie back.

308
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,418
You know what? I'm gonna go.

309
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,494
I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

310
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,454
Oh, my God!

311
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,888
Look at that!

312
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,453
I know!

313
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,691
Well, isn't that amazing?

314
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,898
What are we supposed to see?

315
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,289
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

316
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,093
If you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes. . .

317
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,495
. . .it kind of looks
like an old potato.

318
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,292
Then don't do that, all right?

319
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,733
What do you think?

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,779
Are you welling up?

You are.

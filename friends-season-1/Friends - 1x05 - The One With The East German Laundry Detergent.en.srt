1
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,941
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,863
Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,864
You reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:12,187
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:13,865
As far as I'm concerned. . .

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,228
. . .there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:18,301
Come on!

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,303
You guys can pee standing up.

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,667
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,870
You know what blows my mind?

11
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,188
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

12
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,381
You just look down,
and there they are.

13
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,025
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,827
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things. . .

15
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,384
. . .and then not even care.

16
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,027
Multiple orgasms!

17
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:57,147
The One With
the East German Laundry Detergent

19
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,189
Saturday night. The big night!

20
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,423
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

21
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,626
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!

22
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,542
Not even breaking up
with Janice?

23
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,941
Right, right. Shut up.

24
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,384
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

25
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:07,061
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

26
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,144
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

27
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,746
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

28
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:16,142
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

29
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,861
Why do you have to break up with her?

30
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,585
Be a man. Just stop calling.

31
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:28,948
If you want, I'll do it with you.

32
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,668
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

33
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,425
You break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

34
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,024
You're breaking up with Tony?

35
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,831
He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

36
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,222
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

37
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,944
Do you want anything else?

38
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:51,503
You had a nutty, chocolate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

39
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,544
Nothing. I'm fine.

40
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,948
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

41
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:02,463
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

42
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,423
That guy, he burns me up.

43
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,863
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

44
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,909
It was horrible!
He called me ''young lady. ''

45
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,426
I hate when my father
calls me that.

46
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,628
Did he give you that
''You're not up to this'' thing again?

47
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,709
I got the extended disco
version with choruses of. . .

48
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,708
. . . ''You'll Never Make it on Your Own. ''

49
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,024
Hi, Joey.

50
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,346
Oh, my God! Angela!

51
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,623
Wow! Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

52
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,668
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

53
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,864
Yeah. No.

54
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,829
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

55
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,225
One Mississippi, two Mississippi. . .

56
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,587
. . .three Mississippi.
That seems cool.

57
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,019
Hey, Angela.

58
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,620
You look good.

59
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:04,023
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

60
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,386
You don't say.

61
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,659
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

62
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,221
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

63
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,022
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,983
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:29,064
-Who?
-Me!

66
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,583
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,059
Why don't. . . .

68
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,263
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,826
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,430
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

71
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,949
But there's a rat problem.

72
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:56,263
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

73
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,224
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all. . .

74
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,941
. . .fluffy.

75
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,860
Anyway, 7-ish?

76
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,187
Sure.

77
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,222
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

78
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,661
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

79
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,230
Bob is great.

80
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,468
He's smart, sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

81
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:22,465
You go on three auditions a month
and call yourself an actor. But Bob--

82
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,583
Come on! We were great together.

83
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:30,029
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

84
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,944
Sorry, Joey. You said,
''Let's just be friends. ''

85
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,590
So guess what?

86
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,827
-What?
-We're just friends.

87
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,664
Fine. Fine.

88
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:45,506
Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

89
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,025
What ''four of us''?

90
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:50,581
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend. . .

91
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:53,267
. . .Monica.

92
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:56,269
I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.

93
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,100
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

94
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:04,666
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's. . .

95
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,980
. . .brother.

96
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,147
He's smart, he's sophisticated. . .

97
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,063
. . .and he has a real job.

98
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,065
I go on three auditions a month
and call myself an actor, but Bob is--

99
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,824
-Oh, God help us.
-What?

100
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,465
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

101
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,420
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

102
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother. . .

103
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,023
. . .maybe Angela will come back to me.

104
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,422
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girls.

105
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,030
I know, but. . . .

106
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,223
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

107
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,661
Will you help me? Please?

108
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:54,867
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

109
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:59,149
Hold on there, camper.
You've thought this through?

110
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,428
It's laundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimal.

111
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,547
Just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?

112
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,941
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

113
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,426
What are you saying?

114
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,980
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?

115
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,428
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

116
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:27,630
It's the first time she'll see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

117
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,501
And the fabric softener?

118
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,381
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

119
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,426
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

120
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,026
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

121
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,420
I can pick something else
up on the way.

122
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:56,867
Thank you.

123
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,188
So what does this Bob guy
look like? Is he tall, short?

124
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,224
Yep.

125
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,987
Which?

126
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,625
Which what?

127
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,107
You've never met Bob, have you?

128
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,341
No, but--

129
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,866
For all we know,
he could be horribly--

130
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,022
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

131
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,021
Where are they? Where are they?

132
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,428
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

133
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,024
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

134
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,705
I don't wanna do that.

135
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,990
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

136
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:45,141
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.

137
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,468
I had the most supremely awful day.

138
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:50,985
That's not good.

139
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,224
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?

140
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,269
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetables.

141
00:08:58,511 --> 00:08:59,466
They sucked.

142
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:02,589
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

143
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:05,629
And I got you. . . .

144
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,704
I'm looking. I'm looking.

145
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:11,147
I'm looking.

146
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,059
-I got you--
-What?

147
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,820
-What?
-What did you get me there?

148
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,420
I got you. . .

149
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,230
. . .these.

150
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,862
Bullwinkle socks.

151
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,386
-That's so sweet.
-I knew you had the Rockys.

152
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,622
So you could wear
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle. . .

153
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:31,829
. . .or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

154
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,828
Moose and squirrel.

155
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,828
Whatever you want.

156
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,271
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

157
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,229
No, I'm still working on mine.

158
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:53,667
That's it?

159
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,264
Yeah, it was really hard.

160
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,542
The hug looked pretty brutal.

161
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,419
You weren't there.

162
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,021
Coming through! Move! Move!

163
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:22,262
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

164
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,820
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

165
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,744
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

166
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,346
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

167
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,469
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

168
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:37,866
What?

169
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,068
No suds, no save, okay?

170
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,230
What's going on?

171
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:50,026
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

172
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,710
Was your basket on top?

173
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,067
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

174
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,744
You know, no suds, no save.

175
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,868
No suds, no--
Excuse me.

176
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:59,624
Hold on a second!

177
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,901
This is my friend's machine.

178
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,221
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

179
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,305
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

180
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,870
All right. Show's over.

181
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,827
Nothing to see here.

182
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,230
Let's do laundry.

183
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:33,060
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

184
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:37,623
Well, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentle. . . .

185
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,588
You must need detergent.

186
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,268
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

187
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,183
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

188
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,302
Are you gonna separate those?

189
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,230
Oh, God.

190
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,266
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

191
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,186
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

192
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,547
Have you never done this before?

193
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,783
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

194
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,423
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

195
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,989
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

196
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:34,140
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

197
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,461
A whole other machine
for your colors.

198
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,430
And a third for your. . .

199
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,871
. . .delicates.
And that would be your bras. . .

200
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,228
. . .and your underpanty things.

201
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,227
These are white cotton panties.

202
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,820
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

203
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,422
That would be a judgment call.

204
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,109
He's so cute!

205
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,589
So where did you guys grow up?

206
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,822
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.

207
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,109
-How did that happen?
-Oh, my God!

208
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,824
What?

209
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,461
I suddenly had the feeling I was. . .

210
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,224
. . .falling.

211
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,501
But I'm not.

212
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,661
So, you and Angela, huh?

213
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,027
Yep. Pretty much.

214
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:38,830
You're a lucky man.

215
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:41,867
You know what I miss
the most about her?

216
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:45,228
That cute nibbley noise
she makes when she eats.

217
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,389
Like a happy little squirrel. . .

218
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,623
. . .or a weasel.

219
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,344
I never really noticed.

220
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,860
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

221
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,622
Monica. Monica is great.

222
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,021
Yeah, she is.

223
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,341
But it's not gonna last.

224
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,221
She's too much for me in bed.

225
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,346
Sexually.

226
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,664
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

227
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:17,139
Yeah, isn't he?

228
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,144
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny. . .

229
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,621
. . .and has an emotional age beyond 8.

230
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,227
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

231
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:33,143
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

232
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,385
That's nice.

233
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,264
You can do this. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

234
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,345
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

235
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,024
Go! Go!

236
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,500
Hi, Janice.

237
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:08,266
I don't think we should
go out anymore.

238
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,830
All right.

239
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,029
Well, there you go.

240
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,349
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

241
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,828
I know this is gonna sound
really stupid. . .

242
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,221
. . .but I feel that if I can do this. . .

243
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,224
. . .if I can actually do
my own laundry. . .

244
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,228
. . .there isn't anything I can't do.

245
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,426
That does not sound stupid to me.

246
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:49,584
The first time I had to make dinner
for myself after Carol left me. . . .

247
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,625
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross. . . .

248
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:56,505
-Uh-oh.
-What, ''uh-oh''?

249
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,820
Uh-oh. . . .

250
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,829
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

251
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,863
It's a song.

252
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,863
The laundry song that we sing.

253
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:10,068
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

254
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:11,861
What's the matter?

255
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,146
Nothing. Nothing.

256
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:14,665
The laundry's done

257
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:15,946
Come on, show me.

258
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:20,104
It's just that you left a red sock
in with your whites, and now. . .

259
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,827
. . .everything's kind of pink.

260
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,550
Everything's pink?

261
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,430
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

262
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:33,260
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

263
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,308
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

264
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,987
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

265
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,943
What am I doing? What am I doing?

266
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,228
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

267
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,820
I can't even do laundry!

268
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,668
Something went wrong
with Underdog. . .

269
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,027
. . .and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.

270
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,824
So anyway. . .

271
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,704
. . .his head is, like,
flopping down Broadway.

272
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,826
And I'm thinking. . .

273
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,630
. . .how inappropriate this is.

274
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:18,825
Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?

275
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:23,384
-Oh, my God!
-What?

276
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,225
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like. . .

277
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:28,626
. . .cocktails in Appalachia.

278
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,747
They're close.

279
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,949
Close? She's got her
tongue in his ear.

280
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:41,545
Like you've never got a little
rambunctious with Ross.

281
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,260
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's. . .

282
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,663
. . .not really true, is it?

283
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,503
Who's to say what's true?

284
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:51,786
What were you thinking?

285
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,465
I'm not proud of this, okay?

286
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,064
Maybe I am a little.

287
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,868
-I'm out of here!
-Wait! Come on!

288
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:01,868
You like him. I want her.

289
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,464
He likes you.

290
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,027
Really?

291
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us. . .

292
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,022
. . .we can break them up.

293
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

294
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:20,621
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

295
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,828
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

296
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,146
Here's the thing.
It's like we're different.

297
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:41,463
I'm the bing, bing, bing.
You're the boom, boom, boom.

298
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,030
Oh, my God!

299
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,147
I'm so sorry!

300
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:45,950
Are you okay?

301
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,067
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

302
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,230
I'll be right back.

303
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,741
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

304
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:59,347
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

305
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,263
Oh, my God!

306
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,710
How many have you had?

307
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,021
I don't know. A million!

308
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:10,988
Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

309
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,666
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-All right.

310
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,623
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

311
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,583
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

312
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,065
How do you do that?

313
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,267
It's like a gift.

314
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:47,061
We should always break up together.

315
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,380
I'd like that!

316
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:53,423
You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

317
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:56,862
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

318
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:03,666
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,300
Excuse me. We had this cart.

320
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:09,585
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

321
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,986
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

322
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:15,701
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

323
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,868
There aren't any clothes in it!

324
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,579
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

325
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,822
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

326
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,427
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart. . .

327
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:29,065
. . .you're gonna have to
take me with it!

328
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,868
Yes! Did you see that?

329
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,260
You were incredible.

330
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,860
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

331
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,346
I could not have
done this without you.

332
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,623
More clothes in the dryer?

333
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,827
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

334
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,226
Are you sure you're okay?

335
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,422
Does it still hurt?

336
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:13,626
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

337
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:17,466
How'd it go?

338
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,700
Excellent!

339
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:23,024
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

340
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,505
What a beautiful story.

341
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,105
I'm fine, by the way.

342
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:30,625
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:31,987
Where's Chandler?

344
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,903
He needed some time to grieve.

345
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,301
I'm free! I'm free!

346
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,824
That ought to do it.

1
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,762
Oh, look, look!
There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:10,246
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,250
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,881
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:18,208
The exclamation point scares me.

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,602
It's not just Freud,
it's Freud!

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,610
Magic is about to happen!

8
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,125
Well, Eva. . .

9
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,850
. . .we've done
some excellent work here.

10
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:32,730
And I would have to say. . .

11
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:36,847
. . .your problem is quite clear.

12
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:41,684
All you want is a dinkle

13
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:44,805
What you envy's a schwang

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,209
A thing through which you can tinkle

15
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,972
To play with or simply let hang

16
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,288
The One With the Butt

17
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,561

18
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,008
I feel violated.

19
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:52,764
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off. . .

20
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,803
. . .to have something else to do?

21
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:56,441
Ross, 1 0:00.

22
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,410
Is it? It feels like 2.

23
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,410
No, 1 0:00!

24
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:07,001
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

25
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,207
Hello!

26
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:11,248
She's amazing!

27
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,087
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

28
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:17,890
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

29
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,844
And what would my opening line be?

30
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:21,411
Excuse me. . . .

31
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,122
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

32
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:29,210
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

33
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:32,210
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

34
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:37,841
But you always see these beautiful
women with these ''nothing'' guys.

35
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,003
You could be one of those guys.

36
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,724
-You could do that.
-You think?

37
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:43,802
Absolutely!

38
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,526
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

39
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,240
-I'm very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

40
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:50,641
Here goes.

41
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,123
Okay, next word would be. . .

42
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,321
. . .Chandler.

43
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:06,012
Chandler is my name and. . . .

44
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:07,328
Hi!

45
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,845
Yes, you said that.

46
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,925
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say. . .

47
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:16,123
. . .what I wanted to say was. . .

48
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:19,404
. . .would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

49
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:21,201
Chandler?

50
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,488
There he is!

51
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,081
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

52
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,411
What'd you think?

53
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:33,284
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

54
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,052
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

55
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,369
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

56
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,568
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

57
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,251
She said yes! She said yes!

58
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:47,210
Awful play, man!

59
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,845
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian
and she pronounces my name ''Chandler. ''

60
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,844
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.

61
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:02,010
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

62
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:04,931
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

63
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:06,247
Based on this play?

64
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,683
Based on this play!

65
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,407
Hey, kids!

66
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,968
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

67
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,841
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

68
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,366
How was your date, Chandler?

69
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,766
It was unbelievable!

70
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:37,567
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

71
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,046
She was in the Israeli army.

72
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,442
None of the bullets hit
the engine block. . .

73
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,967
. . .so we made it to the border.

74
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,003
But just barely and I. . . .

75
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,806
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,003
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

77
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,001
All right, once. . .

78
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,846
. . .once I got on the subway, right?

79
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,650
And it was at night. . .

80
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:02,406
. . .and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn. . .

81
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,010
. . .just for the hell of it.

82
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:08,280
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

83
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,368
More or less.

84
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:12,847
Suddenly, we realized
we were in Yemen.

85
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:14,765
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is. . .?

86
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:16,806
''We'' is me and Rick.

87
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:17,928
Who's Rick?

88
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,366
Who's Rick?

89
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,522
My husband.

90
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:26,167
-Oh, so you're divorced?
-No.

91
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:30,209
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

92
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:32,765
No, I'm still married.

93
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:38,610
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me. . .

94
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,162
. . .sliding your foot
so far up my leg. . .

95
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:43,806
. . .you can count
the change in my pocket?

96
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:46,646
Don't worry.

97
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,730
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

98
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,521
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

99
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,489
Ethan is my. . .

100
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:57,888
. . .boyfriend.

101
00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,247
What?!

102
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,045
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having. . .

103
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,720
. . .if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

104
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,001
I suppose, mainly sexual.

105
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:15,050
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

106
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:18,404
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

107
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,205
Didn't you listen to the story?

108
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,204
Didn't you listen to the story?

109
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:27,006
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

110
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,528
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get all the good stuff.

111
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:34,008
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex. . .

112
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,804
. . .and no responsibility.

113
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,090
This is every guy's fantasy!

114
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:41,726
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

115
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,610
No, of course not.

116
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,564
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

117
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:51,807
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

118
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:53,088
I couldn't.

119
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,281
Good for you.

120
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:56,642
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know. . .

121
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:59,605
. . .that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

122
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,122
You know. . .

123
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:04,210
. . .monogamy can be a tricky concept.

124
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:06,801
I mean, anthropologically speaking. . . .

125
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,403
Fine. Now you'll never know.

126
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,165
We're kidding. Tell us.

127
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:13,851
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

128
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:17,767
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey--

129
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,484
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

130
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,684
Look! I cleaned!

131
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,042
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

132
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,449
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

133
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,005
I don't know what it's for.

134
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,322
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.

135
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,641
What do you think?

136
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,486
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

137
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,281
I see you moved the green ottoman.

138
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,485
How did that happen?

139
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,247
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

140
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:08,643
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

141
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,083
Yeah, it's interesting.

142
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,608
But you know what? Just for fun. . .

143
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:18,402
. . .let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

144
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,810
Just to compare.

145
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,240
Let's see.

146
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,449
Well, it looks good there too.

147
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,928
Let's leave it there for a while.

148
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:30,611
I can't believe you tried
to move the green ottoman.

149
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,808
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

150
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,809
She'll scratch your eyes out.

151
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,804
You guys, I am not that bad!

152
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,206
Yeah, you are.

153
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:42,005
Remember, I lived with you?

154
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:44,004
You were a little, you know. . . .

155
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,080
That is so unfair!

156
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,967
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

157
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,206
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

158
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,164
But, hey, I can be a kook!

159
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,443
All right, you madcap gal!

160
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,247
Try to imagine this.

161
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:11,001
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

162
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:12,048
Why not?

163
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,731
Because you're a kook!

164
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,411
lnstead, you wait until
they send you a notice.

165
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,441
I could do that.

166
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:24,440
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping. . .

167
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:26,370
. . .and I buy laundry detergent.

168
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,889
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

169
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:31,650
Why would someone do that?

170
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,808
One might wonder.

171
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,652
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

172
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,610
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

173
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:45,410
Beads of condensation are inching
their way closer to the wood. . . .

174
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,641
Stop it!

175
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:51,440
Oh, my God!

176
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,723
It's true. Who am I?

177
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,168
Monica, you're Mom.

178
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,201
Oh, my God!

179
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,410
Okay, I'll be there.

180
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,205
That was my agent.

181
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:19,643
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

182
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:22,331
That's great!

183
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:23,648
What's the part?

184
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,808
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!

185
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,804
This guy's why I became an actor.

186
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,242
''I'm out of order?
You're out of order!

187
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:33,211
This whole courtroom's out of order! ''

188
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:35,804
Seriously, what's the part?

189
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,567
''Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! ''

190
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,804
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?

191
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:46,205
You're, you're. . . .
What?

192
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,967
I'm his butt double, okay?

193
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,646
I play Al Pacino's butt.

194
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:02,929
All right? He goes
into the shower, and then. . .

195
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:04,605
. . .I'm his butt.

196
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:06,601
Oh, my God!

197
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,007
Come on, you guys.

198
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,403
This is a real movie
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!

199
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,005
Oh, no, it's terrific.

200
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,328
After all your years of struggling. . .

201
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,604
. . .you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

202
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:23,927
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.

203
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:25,525
This is a big break for me!

204
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,330
You're right. It is.

205
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,211
So are you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

206
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,046
-I need to borrow some moisturizer.
-For what?

207
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,163
What do you think?
Today's the big day!

208
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,411
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

209
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,206
Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

210
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:55,647
Thank you.

211
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,483
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-He's in the bathroom.

212
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:04,002
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we're roommates.

213
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:08,041
My eyes! My eyes!

214
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:11,925
I warned you.

215
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,890
Who is being loud?

216
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,003
Oh, that would be Monica.

217
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:19,205
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

218
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,124
You got the whole night, huh?

219
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:24,523
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so. . . .

220
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:26,603
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

221
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:29,810
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me. . .

222
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,043
. . .it's worth it, okay?

223
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,368
In a relationship,
you have these key moments. . .

224
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,927
. . .you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

225
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,244
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.

226
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,881
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.

227
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,209
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

228
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,760
You know, the old Monica
would remind you. . .

229
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,601
. . .to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

230
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,803
But I'm not gonna do that.

231
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,602
Damn it! Hire the girl.

232
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,841
Okay, everybody ready?

233
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:11,087
Listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

234
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,281
Lose the robe.

235
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:15,328
Me?

236
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:16,766
That would work.

237
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:20,005
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

238
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,329
Okay, and the robe is lost.

239
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:26,765
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

240
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,246
Let's roll it.

241
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:29,805
Water's working.

242
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,290
And action!

243
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,645
And cut!

244
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:37,851
Butt guy, what are you doing?

245
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:40,441
I'm showering.

246
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:42,371
No, that was clenching.

247
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,801
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

248
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,202
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

249
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,006
I think his butt would be angry here.

250
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:55,531
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

251
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,205
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

252
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,003
And action!

253
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,611
And cut!

254
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:05,648
What was that?

255
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:09,167
I was going for quiet desperation.

256
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:13,211
But if you have to ask. . . .

257
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,404
God, I love these fingers.

258
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,767
Thank you.

259
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,406
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

260
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,807
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

261
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:33,650
-Oh, my God, I'm late!
-Oh, no, no, no.

262
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,690
-Don't go, don't go.
-Okay, okay.

263
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,489
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

264
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,646
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

265
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,410
I thought you talked to Rick.

266
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,449
It's not Rick.

267
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,688
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!

268
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,525
No, it's Andrew.

269
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:57,803
I know there'll be many moments. . .

270
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:01,209
. . .when I'll regret asking
the following question, but. . . .

271
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,365
And Andrew is. . .?

272
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:04,448
He's. . .

273
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:05,607
. . .new.

274
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,890
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

275
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,447
No, that's not exactly what I was--

276
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,404
Most women would kill. . .

277
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,608
. . .for three guys like us.

278
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,240
So what do you want?

279
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:21,928
You.

280
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,851
-You have me.
-No, no. Just you.

281
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:26,208
What do you mean?

282
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,204
Lose the other guys.

283
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,810
Like, all of them?

284
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:35,325
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

285
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,603
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

286
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,042
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love. . .

287
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:42,965
. . .without feeling obligated
to one another?

288
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,808
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

289
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,803
Well, part of me wants that. . .

290
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:52,128
. . .but it's like I'm two guys.

291
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,205
I mean, one guy's saying,
''Shut up! This is great! ''

292
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,964
But there's this other guy.

293
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:01,050
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart. . .

294
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,011
. . .grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.

295
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:08,611
He's saying, you know,
''This is too hard. Get out, get out! ''

296
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,165
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

297
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:16,762
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

298
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:19,368
Which one?

299
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,128
The second guy.

300
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:26,881
I see.

301
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,608
Call me if you change your mind.

302
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:45,004
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

303
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,085
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

304
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,562
Right? I mean, this woman was. . .

305
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,330
. . .unbelievably sexy. . .

306
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:08,769
. . .and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable. . . .

307
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,803
Tell me why you did this again?

308
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:16,485
Movie star!

309
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:20,207
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

310
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,288
Nope.

311
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:26,001
No? What happened, big guy?

312
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,605
Big guy?

313
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,808
It felt like a ''big guy'' moment.

314
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:33,722
I got fired!

315
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:36,763
They said I acted too much with it.

316
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,244
I told everybody about this.

317
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,329
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

318
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:46,006
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

319
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,805
My mom will.

320
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,643
There's something so sweet. . .

321
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,008
. . .and disturbing about that.

322
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,050
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years. . .

323
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,170
. . .and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

324
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,044
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

325
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:07,609
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

326
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,607
Did it feel like your shot?

327
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:14,440
Hard to tell. I was naked.

328
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,205
I don't think this was your shot.

329
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,607
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

330
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:22,043
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

331
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:26,001
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go. . .

332
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:29,727
. . . ''I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass! ''

333
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,406
You think? That's so nice.

334
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

335
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,201
Good night.

336
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,688
You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

337
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:55,803
Really? Just casually
strewn about. . .

338
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,207
. . .in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

339
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:03,601
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

340
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:06,401
Whenever.

341
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,611
She is a kook.

342
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:29,005
If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.

343
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,000
No, don 't do this!

344
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,605
This is stupid!

345
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,810
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

346
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,244
But then everyone will know.

347
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:45,810
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

348
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:47,685
I need help!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

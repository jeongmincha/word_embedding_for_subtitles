1
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:10,687
Terry, I know I haven't
worked here long. . .

2
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:13,207
. . .but I was wondering,
would it be possible. . .

3
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:16,410
. . .if I got a $ 100 advance
on my salary?

4
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:18,160
An advance?

5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,727
So that I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

6
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:25,011
Every year we ski in Vail, and
my father pays for my ticket. . .

7
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:28,483
. . .but I've started
this whole independent thing. . .

8
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:31,604
. . .which is actually why
I took this ''job. ''

9
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,885
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

10
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,006
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,286
Really, really awful.

12
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,726
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:52,605
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

14
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,683
I really do.

15
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:57,288
Does anybody need coffee?

16
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:04,883
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

17
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:07,161
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:52,728
Excuse me, sir?

19
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:55,486
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering. . .

20
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:59,526
. . .is there a possibility that
you could advance me my tips?

21
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:05,881
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

22
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,403
Only 98.50 to go!

23
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:15,128
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

24
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,249
What? No, they're not.

25
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:18,845
The Blymans invited them.

26
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:19,922
You're wrong.

27
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:22,727
I am not wrong.

28
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,882
You're wrong.

29
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,930
No, I just talked to them.

30
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:29,807
I'm calling Mom.

31
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,201
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

32
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:49,328
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
''Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. ''

33
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:53,405
I was thinking you
look more like ''Joey Tribbiani. . .

34
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,324
. . .man/woman. ''

35
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,326
What were you modeling?

36
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:00,642
You know those posters for
the City Free Clinic?

37
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,282
So you're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

38
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,602
The asthma guy's really cute.

39
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:09,090
Know which one you're gonna be?

40
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:11,522
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so. . . .

41
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,603
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

42
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:16,007
Thanks.

43
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,887
You were right.
How can they do this to us?

44
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,690
It's Thanksgiving!

45
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,888
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

46
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,565
I'll make it just like Mom's.

47
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,890
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

48
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:34,082
They're not actually supposed to--

49
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,084
I'll work on the lumps.

50
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:38,928
Joey, you're going home, right?

51
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:42,881
Chandler, you're still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

52
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,123
Yes. Every single one of them.

53
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:49,684
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.

54
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:53,487
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

55
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,122
So you're free Thursday, then?

56
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:02,488
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

57
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,123
Rach, you still going to Vail?

58
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,284
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop!

59
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:11,602
Only $ 1 02 to go.

60
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,967
I thought it was 98.50?

61
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,772
Well, it was, but I broke a cup.

62
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,363
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

63
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,483
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

64
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:25,086
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife. . .

65
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,484
. . .and will probably want to bring
her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.

66
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:40,321
Is Carol here?

67
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,608
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

68
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:46,691
I just came by to pick up my skull.

69
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,008
Well, not mine, but. . . .

70
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,891
Come in.

71
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:55,411
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I
have to get it back to the museum.

72
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:56,607
What's it look like?

73
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,607
Kind of like a big face without skin.

74
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:05,324
I'm familiar with the concept.

75
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,483
You can just look for it.

76
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:17,884
You guys sure have a lot of books
about being a lesbian.

77
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,927
You know, you have to take a course.

78
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,563
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

79
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,445
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.

80
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,286
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

81
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,364
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

82
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,682
Wouldn't that mean you're. . .

83
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,081
. . .crazy?

84
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,085
What? You don't think they can
hear sounds in there?

85
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,727
You're not serious? I mean. . .

86
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,405
. . .you really talk to it?

87
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:03,163
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

88
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,249
Do you talk about me?

89
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,048
All the time.

90
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,088
Really?

91
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,089
We just refer to you
as ''Bobo, the sperm guy. ''

92
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:30,282
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly-time too.

93
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,688
Not that I believe any of this.

94
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:36,368
I believe it. I think the baby can
totally hear everything.

95
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,363
I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.

96
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:43,002
But you put your head
inside this turkey. . .

97
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:46,289
. . .and we'll all talk and you'll
hear everything we say.

98
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:51,687
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

99
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,882
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

100
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,532
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.

101
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,683
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

102
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:09,288
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

103
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,921
Here's your mail.

104
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,288
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table.

105
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:20,083
Here's your mail!

106
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:24,288
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table!

107
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,490
Would you just open it!

108
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,889
Oh, my God!

109
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:34,090
You guys are great!

110
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,363
We all chipped in.

111
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:37,527
We did?

112
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,330
You owe me $20.

113
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,921
Thank you. Thank you so much!

114
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,241
Chandler, here you go.

115
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,847
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup. . .

116
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:49,926
. . .grilled-cheese fixings and
your family-size bag of Funyuns.

117
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,402
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

118
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,086
What is it with you
and this holiday?

119
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:57,851
I'm 9 years old.

120
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,571
I hate this story!

121
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,689
We've just finished
Thanksgiving dinner.

122
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,723
I have-- I remember
this part vividly--

123
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,928
--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

124
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:09,926
And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.

125
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:11,406
Oh, my God!

126
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:15,884
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

127
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,730
We used to work together.

128
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:36,848
We did?

129
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:40,484
At Macy's. You're
the Obsession girl, right?

130
00:08:41,252 --> 00:08:43,083
I was the Aramis guy.

131
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:46,892
Aramis? Aramis?

132
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,127
Yeah, right!

133
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:52,162
You're the best in the business.

134
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:53,891
-Get out!
-I'm serious!

135
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:58,091
You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.

136
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,882
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

137
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:07,568
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

138
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,364
Nothing.

139
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:21,367
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

140
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,285
Yeah, that would be--

141
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,530
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.

142
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,491
What?

143
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,251
Leave.

144
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,488
Wait, wait, wait!

145
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,571
I guess you all saw it.

146
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:20,928
Saw what?

147
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:24,722
We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

148
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:47,446
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

149
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,527
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

150
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,805
Looking good! Okay!

151
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:09,284
Cider's mulling, turkey's
turking, yams are yamming. . . .

152
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,326
What?

153
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:15,202
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

154
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,566
That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!

155
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,291
Well, that's closer.

156
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,285
I got the tickets!

157
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:27,320
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

158
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,927
Oh, you must stop shooping.

159
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,083
I'm gonna get my stuff.

160
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,444
Will you just come in, already?

161
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:38,162
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

162
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:41,484
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

163
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:51,686
We all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

164
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:56,842
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

165
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:58,690
That's not a question.

166
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,692
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.

167
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:05,686
A piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

168
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,282
I mean it's. . .

169
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:13,084
. . .bad enough I can't be with
my family, because of my disease.

170
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:15,728
All right. Fine.

171
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:19,123
Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .

172
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,488
. . .and in the form of Tots.

173
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:26,167
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

174
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:30,084
Mom never hit.

175
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:36,290
Okay, all done.

176
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,890
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

177
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,491
Ross needs lumps!

178
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,523
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--

179
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:48,488
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

180
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,281
Why would we do that?

181
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,921
Then they'd be like
my mom used to make it. . .

182
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,400
. . .before she died.

183
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:00,691
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

184
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,969
Goodbye, you guys!

185
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,281
Thanks for everything!

186
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:09,286
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:14,527
The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!

188
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:15,528
The balloon?

189
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,247
No, the actual cartoon character.

190
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,648
Of course the balloon!

191
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,291
It's all over the news.

192
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:27,241
He broke free and was spotted
over Washington Square Park.

193
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,010
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?

194
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,605
I can't. I gotta go!

195
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,288
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?

196
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,084
Almost never.

197
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:37,687
Got the keys?

198
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,446
Anytime you're ready!

199
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,084
Okay, here we go.

200
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,291
Where am I talking to here?

201
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:02,884
There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .

202
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,605
Just aim for the bump.

203
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,090
Okay, here goes.

204
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,728
You know, I can't do this.

205
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:24,968
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

206
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,766
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

207
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,283
Hello, baby!

208
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,921
--the moment we first saw the giant dog
shadow fall over the park!

209
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,209
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

210
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:47,202
Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .

211
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,090
. . .and juicy on the inside.

212
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,284
Why are we standing here?

213
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,768
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You've got the keys.

214
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:57,485
No, I don't.

215
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,321
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, ''Got the keys. ''

216
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,689
No, I didn't. I asked. . .

217
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,048
. . . ''Got the keys?''

218
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,762
You said, ''Got the keys! ''

219
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:13,685
Either of you have the keys?

220
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,082
The oven is on!

221
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,771
I've gotta get my ticket!

222
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,650
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

223
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:20,881
Then get it!

224
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:23,362
That tone won't make me go any faster.

225
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:25,886
That one will.

226
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:33,090
And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''

227
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,086
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

228
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:43,287
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

229
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:47,491
You're just happy you don't
have gills anymore.

230
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,611
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

231
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,412
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.

232
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,605
How's it going?

233
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,683
Here we come

234
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,689
Walking down the street

235
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:05,720
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

236
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,291
Hey, hey--

237
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,125
-Did you feel that?
-I did.

238
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,522
-Does it always--?
-That was the first!

239
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:17,285
Keep singing! Keep singing!

240
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:20,283
Hey, hey, you're my baby

241
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,287
And I can 't wait to meet you

242
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,280
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

243
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,770
I felt it that time!

244
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:31,331
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

245
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,291
I'm the one without any breasts

246
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,287
Not that one.

247
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,124
Can you go any faster?

248
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:45,285
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

249
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,285
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

250
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,881
For an emergency just like this.

251
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,566
All right. Listen, smirky!

252
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,723
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon. . .

253
00:16:56,972 --> 00:17:01,568
. . .I'd be on a plane watching a woman
do this right now. But I'm not!

254
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,211
I swear you said you had the keys!

255
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:08,012
I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!

256
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,123
I obviously did not have the keys!

257
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:13,284
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !

258
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:18,082
Why would I have the keys!

259
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:20,643
Besides the fact that
you said you did?

260
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:23,002
-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.

261
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,401
-Why?
-Because!

262
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,682
Because everything's
my responsibility?

263
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:29,247
Isn't it enough that I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:33,405
Everyone wants a different potato,
so I'm making different potatoes.

265
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,486
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?

266
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:43,130
Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .

267
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,283
. . .and Mario gets his Tots.

268
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,007
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

269
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,807
It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .

270
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,402
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

271
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:59,086
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.

272
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,288
The turkey's burnt!

273
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:11,087
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

274
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,320
Here we come

275
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,683
Walking down the--

276
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,082
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

277
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,401
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.

278
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:26,768
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!

279
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,486
God, this is great!

280
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,809
The plane is gone, so I guess
I'm stuck here with you guys.

281
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:37,886
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!

282
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,081
Oh, really?

283
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:43,166
So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?

284
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:44,447
You call that delicious?

285
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:49,570
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,448
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

287
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,042
What?

288
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,648
Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.

289
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:17,132
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

290
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,441
Ugly Naked Guy. . .

291
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,525
. . .is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

292
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,090
I gotta see this!

293
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,208
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

294
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:33,087
Ugly naked dancing!

295
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,207
It's nice that he has someone.

296
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:47,681
Shall I carve?

297
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:49,767
By all means.

298
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,685
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

299
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,485
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

300
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:05,481
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.

301
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:07,131
You guys have to make a wish.

302
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:08,962
Make a wish?

303
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,282
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

304
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,405
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

305
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,884
The bigger half.

306
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:25,282
All right, I'd like to
propose a toast.

307
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:27,683
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

308
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:31,045
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

309
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:34,921
. . .but for me this has
been really great.

310
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:38,482
I think because it didn't
involve divorce. . .

311
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,284
. . .or projectile vomiting.

312
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,210
If you had gone to Vail. . .

313
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,888
. . .or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have. . .

314
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:49,971
. . .syphilis and stuff. . .

315
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,090
. . .we wouldn't be
all together.

316
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,806
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is. . .

317
00:20:57,052 --> 00:21:01,682

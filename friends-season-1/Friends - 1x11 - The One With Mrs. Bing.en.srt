1
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:05,030
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:08,422
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:13,220
Oh, my God! Don't look now.
Behind you there's a guy. . .

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,144
. . .who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,346
Where?

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,383
Come to Mama!

7
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,300
He's coming!
Be cool! Be cool! Be cool!

8
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,707
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

9
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,779
-We should do something. Whistle.
-We're not whistling.

10
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:29,821
Come on, do it!

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,226
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,701
I can't believe you did that!

13
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:42,667
The One With Mrs. Bing

14
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,940
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,183
Why did I woo-hoo?

16
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:30,541
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say. . .

17
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,941
. . . ''I love that sound.
I must have you now''?

18
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:37,224
I just wish there was something
we could do.

19
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,860
Hello, coma guy.

20
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,542
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!

21
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,940
What are you doing?

22
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,022
Maybe nobody's tried this.

23
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,020
I wish we at least knew his name.

24
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,823
Look at that face.

25
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,865
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

26
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,387
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.

27
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:06,864
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

28
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,590
And he can dance!

29
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:13,429
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening. . .

30
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,269
. . .not saying, ''I understand'' . . .

31
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,025
. . .but really wondering
what you look like naked.

32
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:23,385
I wish all guys could be like him.

33
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:26,060
I know.

34
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,824
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

35
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,865
He doesn't have anyone.

36
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:38,147
We feel kind of responsible.

37
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:41,220
I can't believe you said, ''Woo-hoo! ''

38
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,264
I don't even say, ''Woo-hoo! ''

39
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,024
Oh, she's coming up!

40
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:49,742
When we come back, we'll talk with
the always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing!

41
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,947
Put the kids to bed for this one.

42
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:55,627
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO!

43
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,747
No way!

44
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,704
Come on! She's your mom!

45
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,748
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

46
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:03,585
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

47
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:08,668
I gotta tell you, I love
your mom's books! I love them!

48
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,471
I cannot get on a plane without one.
This is so cool!

49
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,020
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 1 1 . . .

50
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,190
. . .and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

51
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,907
I love your mom!
I think she's a blast!

52
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,903
You can say that.
She's not your mom.

53
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,425
Oh, please! She's the--

54
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,349
Hi, sweetie!

55
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,824
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

56
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,459
-Last night.
-Really?

57
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:36,828
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

58
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,868
Just a dream I had.

59
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,266
But. . . .

60
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,819
Hey, hey, hey! She's on!

61
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,310
Nora Bing!

62
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:53,063
Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?

63
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:54,989
Your mom was arrested?

64
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,102
I'm busy beaming with pride.

65
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,589
This is kind of embarrassing...

66
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:03,788
...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man...

67
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,386
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

68
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,508
...I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

69
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,742
That's too much information!

70
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:19,070
So now you're doing this book tour.
How's that going?

71
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:23,145
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

72
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,461
But I get to see my son, who I love!

73
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:30,820
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

74
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,985
Don 't take this wrong, I just
don 't see you as a mom somehow.

75
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,945
-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom!

76
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,422
I bought my son his first condoms.

77
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,461
And then he burst into flames.

78
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,024
Let's see. ''Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

79
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:04,307
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.

80
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,947
The high today was 45. ''

81
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,185
Teams played sports.

82
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:36,830
What about Glen?

83
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,306
He could be a Glen.

84
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:40,348
Not special enough.

85
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,663
How about Agamemnon?

86
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,510
Way too special.

87
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,226
I'm famished. What do I want?

88
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,543
Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

89
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,504
You watched the show!
What did you think?

90
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,106
I think you need to come out
of your shell.

91
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,544
What is this dive?

92
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,027
Only you could've picked this place.

93
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,669
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

94
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,464
-I think we're ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

95
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,622
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

96
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,946
There you go. Ross?

97
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:24,905
I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

98
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:26,669
Hi! Sorry we're late.

99
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:30,267
We kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

100
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,262
But a man can change.

101
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,259
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

102
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,949
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've ever written.

103
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:59,230
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
all I wanted to do was become a writer.

104
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:02,144
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

105
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,627
Start with half a dozen
European cities. . .

106
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,425
. . .throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia. . .

107
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,946
. . .and you have got yourself a book!

108
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,665
My mother, ladies and gentlemen!

109
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,310
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

110
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,789
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

111
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,623
What is with you tonight?

112
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,345
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

113
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,430
Okay, thank you.

114
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:48,184
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

115
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,820
No. It's the one he's licking.

116
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,589
She's supposed to be with you.

117
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,580
You're good.

118
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:01,141
I have sold 100 million copies
of my books, and you know why?

119
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,423
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

120
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:11,101
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

121
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:13,148
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

122
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,428
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

123
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:19,668
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

124
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,028
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

125
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,465
When?

126
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,781
He's not a hero.

127
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,030
You know who our hero is?

128
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,779
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

129
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,830
No, it's you.

130
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,470
-Please.
-No, really.

131
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,986
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

132
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,269
-Right.
-Come on, kiddo.

133
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,230
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

134
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:06,942
I'll just pee in the street.

135
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,467
Is Chandler here?

136
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,265
Wait. Come here.

137
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,941
Okay, about last night. . .

138
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,021
. . .you know. . .

139
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,108
. . .Chandler, you didn't tell. . . .

140
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:31,549
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

141
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,543
Right. No big deal.

142
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,383
In Bizarro-world!

143
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:39,820
You broke the code!

144
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,829
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

145
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:46,427
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

146
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,940
But not a mom. Never a mom!

147
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,548
What are you guys doing out here?

148
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,227
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

149
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,543
But apparently somebody overslept.

150
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,268
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

151
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,071
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

152
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,347
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

153
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,424
Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

154
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:19,424
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

155
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,704
I'm scum. I'm scum.

156
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,260
-How could you let this happen?
-I don't know.

157
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,342
It's not like she's a regular mom.

158
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,229
She's sexy. She's. . . .

159
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,621
You don't think my mom's sexy?

160
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,305
Well, not in the same way.

161
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:40,430
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

162
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:45,021
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

163
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,749
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

164
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,265
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,463
Not playing racquetball.

166
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,550
-He forgot to leave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

167
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,900
Sounds like you two have issues.

168
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:10,980
Goodbye, baby.

169
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,506
Do they wait for me to do this?

170
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:24,303
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?

171
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,860
How about, because if you don't,
his mother might?

172
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,426
What are you guys doing here?

173
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,186
He's not even wearing a jock strap!

174
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,462
What did I ask?

175
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,869
What are you doing here?

176
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:59,063
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after. . .

177
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:00,460
. . .that I, you know.

178
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,429
So what are you doing here?

179
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,223
I'm not really here.

180
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:09,788
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

181
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,830
Do you come here a lot. . .

182
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:16,746
. . .without me?

183
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,027
No, no, no.

184
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:25,388
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

185
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,300
How would I know? I wasn't here.

186
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,827
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

187
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,467
Oh, my God!

188
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,350
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.

189
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,189
I can't believe it.

190
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:44,425
Paolo kissed my mom?

191
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:48,823
I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

192
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,585
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk--

193
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,188
I can't do this. I did it.

194
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,746
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

195
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,181
What?

196
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:04,023
I was upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I had too much tequila, and Nora. . .

197
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:06,222
. . .Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was. . .

198
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,341
. . .just being nice.
But nothing happened.

199
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:11,660
Nothing. Ask Joey.

200
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:12,861
Joey came in--

201
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,829
You knew about this?

202
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,221
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

203
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,746
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:24,620
You're lucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?

205
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,184
Thanks, man. Big help.

206
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:28,907
I can't believe this!
What were you thinking?

207
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,142
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

208
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,468
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

209
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,861
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this!

210
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:39,261
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you for not telling me.

211
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,150
-What are you mad at me--?
-Let me slam the door!

212
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:47,270
I didn't kiss her. He did. See
what happens when you break the code?

213
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:03,023
''A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Greene. ''

214
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,428
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

215
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:11,426
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be
''liberated from its denim prison''?

216
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,141
Yeah, I'd say so.

217
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,543
And there's no ''j'' in ''engorged. ''

218
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:20,866
Hey, Rach.

219
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,259
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

220
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,064
No. You?

221
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,580
You just asked me.

222
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,547
Maybe it was a trick question.

223
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,541
Rachel, can we do this now?

224
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,148
I am so hot!

225
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,623
Here's my mother and father
on their wedding day.

226
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,749
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

227
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,908
I cannot believe this conversation.

228
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,585
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

229
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:02,062
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

230
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,941
Thanks.

231
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:09,268
I'd like to start with a song
about a man I recently met. . .

232
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:12,628
. . .who's come to be
very important to me.

233
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:22,260
You don 't have to be awake
To be my man

234
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:29,146
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

235
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,661
Though we just met the other day

236
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:36,221
There's something I have got to say

237
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,149
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

238
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,861
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

239
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,625
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started--

240
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,227
I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

241
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,984
''Mother-kisser. ''

242
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,580
I'll shut up.

243
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,220
Chandler, I know
you're still mad at me. . .

244
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:08,144
. . .but there were two people
there that night.

245
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,589
-There were two sets of lips.
-I expect this from her.

246
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,386
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

247
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,549
If she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

248
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,669
Because it's complicated.
It's complex!

249
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,310
Hey, you kissed my mom!

250
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,102
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

251
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,229
That's funny.
Are we done now?

252
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,503
You mean you're not gonna
tell her how you feel?

253
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:37,823
No. Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom. . .

254
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,068
. . .doesn't mean you know her.
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

255
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:43,506
Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

256
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,190
Okay, that's my finger.

257
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,825
Okay, that's my knee.

258
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,464
Still doing the play.

259
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:00,224
What did you do with him?

260
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,063
-You're awake!
-Look at you!

261
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,222
How do you feel?

262
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,422
A little woozy, but basically okay.

263
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,428
Gosh, you look good!

264
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:13,990
I feel good.

265
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,584
Who are you?

266
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,350
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe Buffay.

267
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,059
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

268
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:22,141
We both have.

269
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,224
-The Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
-Actually, from me.

270
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:28,065
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

271
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,141
I read to you.

272
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:30,460
I sang.

273
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:33,950
Well, thanks.

274
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,307
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You're welcome.

275
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,309
So I guess I'll see you around.

276
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,183
What? That's it?

277
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,269
''See you around''?

278
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:47,469
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

279
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,939
Maybe. . .

280
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,419
. . . ''That was nice. ''

281
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,990
''It meant something to me. ''

282
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,590
''I'll call you. ''

283
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,981
-All right. I'll call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

284
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,863
This is so typical.

285
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,426
You know, we give. . .

286
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,859
. . .and we give. . .

287
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,624
. . .and we give.

288
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,867
And then we just get nothing back.

289
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:14,820
And then one day, it's just,
you wake up, and ''See you around. ''

290
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:18,390
Let's go, Phoebe.

291
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,621
You know what?
We thought you were different.

292
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:25,947
But I guess it was just the coma.

293
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:33,705
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

294
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:38,829
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

295
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:42,503
All right. Well, be good.
I love you.

296
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,024
You kissed my best Ross!

297
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,264
Or something to that effect.

298
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,988
Look, it was stupid.

299
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:02,307
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

300
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,820
And I don't even know how it happened.

301
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:10,581
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.

302
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,229
Are we okay now?

303
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,665
No.

304
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:24,748
The forbidden love
of a man and his door.

305
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:29,508
He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything!

306
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,661
You're kidding?

307
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,425
He said, ''When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?''

308
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,549
Then she came back with. . .

309
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:40,023
. . . ''The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?''

310
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,430
Are you sure she didn't say. . .

311
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:47,419
. . . ''When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?''

312
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,230
That makes more sense.

313
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,506
You think?

314
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,260
What's going on now?

315
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:00,068
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

316
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:03,863
I don't hear anything. Wait!

317
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,066
What do you see?

318
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,620
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.

319
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,099
Wait, wait, wait!

320
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:12,303
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

321
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,221
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

322
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:19,740
Are you okay, kiddo?

323
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,066
Yeah, I'm okay.

324
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,029
All right. You be good.

325
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,829
Drive safe.

326
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,906
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

327
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:38,824
You mean that?

328
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,824
Yeah, why not?

329
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,180
So I told her.

330
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,262
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

331
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,103
Couldn't have gone worse.

332
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:51,663
Well, how do you feel?

333
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:52,787
Pretty good.

334
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,065
I told her.

335
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:58,063
Well, see?

336
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:02,429
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
me kissing your mom, huh?

337
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,906
But we don't have to
go down that road.

338
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,827
This is just the first chapter. . .

339
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:18,428
. . .and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

340
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,990
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts. ''

341
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:25,546
What's a ''niffle''?

342
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,589
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

343
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,747
All right, so I'm not a great typist.

344
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,825
Wait, did you get to the part
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

345
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,828
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those!

346
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:43,902
That's it. Give them back!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

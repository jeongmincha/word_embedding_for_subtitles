1
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:18,969
-I'm sorry!
-Oh, my God! That's it!

2
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:21,328
You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,335
You have no respect
for my privacy?

4
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:25,051
-Rachel, wait!
-No, you wait!

5
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,486
Can I just say one thing?

6
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:27,608
What?! What?

7
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,969
That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your. . .

8
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:32,654
. . .nippular area.

00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,686
The One With the Boobies

00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:26,614
Honey, honey. . .

12
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,372
. . .tell them the story about
your patient. . .

13
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,773
. . .who thinks things are
other things.

14
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,016
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower. . . .

15
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,376
That's pretty much it.

16
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:42,013
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

17
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:43,168
Thanks.

18
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,972
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

19
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,811
Okay. I'll miss you.

20
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:51,814
Isn't he great?

21
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:54,288
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

22
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:55,408
I know. I know.

23
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,491
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

24
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,810
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky. You know?

25
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,935
Think you'll do it on his couch?

26
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:06,817
I don't know. That's a little weird.

27
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:08,377
It's vinyl. . . .

28
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,091
You guys want anything else?

29
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:15,771
-Could I have--
-We're all out.

30
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,206
Anybody else?

31
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,890
Did I miss something?

32
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,170
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

33
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,771
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

34
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:27,814
It was an accident.

35
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:31,977
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

36
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,369
Can we change the subject, please?

37
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,567
Because, hello? These aren't her
''boobies. '' These are her breasts.

38
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:43,016
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

39
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:47,408
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

40
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,773
''Nice''?

41
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,213
They were ''nice''?

42
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,097
That's it?
I mean, mittens are ''nice. ''

43
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,369
Rock, hard place. . .

44
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,374
. . .me.

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,007
You're so funny!

46
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,175
He's really funny!

47
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:13,133
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

48
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,257
Back up there, sparky.

49
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,652
What did you mean by that?

50
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,610
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues. . .

51
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,493
. . .that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

52
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,657
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

53
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,453
Only child, right?

54
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,008
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

55
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:41,574
How did you know?

56
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,327
It's textbook.

57
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,447
Hey, you guys.

58
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,177
You all know my dad, right?

59
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,974
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.

60
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:53,213
I got a job midtown.

61
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,608
I'm better off
staying with the kid. . .

62
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,968
. . .than going back and forth
on the ferry.

63
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,253
I don't know this one.

64
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,535
This is my friend Roger.

65
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,296
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

66
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:06,211
What happened to the puppet guy?

67
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,214
Dad!

68
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:09,773
Excuse me.

69
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,969
So, Ross, how's the wife?

70
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,771
0 for 2, huh?

71
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,574
Chandler, quick,
say something funny!

72
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,777
Gotta go.

73
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,973
I miss you too.

74
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:32,209
I love you,
but it's getting late now--

75
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,016
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma!

76
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:37,773
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and--

77
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:39,967
Excuse me?

78
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,817
Did you know this isn't Ma?

79
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:54,608
Her name's Ronni.

80
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,657
She's a pet mortician.

81
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,773
Sure.

82
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,769
So how long have you been. . . .

83
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:12,096
Remember when you were a kid, we'd
go see the big ships in the navy yard?

84
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:13,248
Since then?

85
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,974
No, it's only been six years.

86
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,770
I wanted to give you
a nice memory. . .

87
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,090
. . .so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

88
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,888
Joe, have you ever been in love?

89
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:28,528
I don't know.

90
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,577
Then you haven't.

91
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,611
You're burning your tomatoes.

92
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,007
You're one to talk.

93
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,369
Your dad's in love, bigtime.

94
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,251
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

95
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:44,410
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

96
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,456
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

97
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,297
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out. . .

98
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,534
. . .your dad was
leading this double life.

99
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:04,572
He's like actually some spy
working for the CIA.

100
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,406
That'd be cool!

101
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:08,571
This blows!

102
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,490
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

103
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,569
Why do they
have to become people?

104
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,649
Why do they have--

105
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:19,173
Why. . .

106
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,409
. . .can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

107
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,767
What?

108
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,173
What?

109
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:33,612
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

110
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,177
We're all adults here.

111
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,051
There's only one way
to resolve this.

112
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,737
Since you saw her boobies. . .

113
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:42,372
. . .you're gonna have to show her
your pee-pee.

114
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,767
You know,
I don't see that happening.

115
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,168
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

116
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,247
Well I'm not showing you my tat!

117
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:10,567
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

118
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:12,893
Come on up.

119
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,976
Oh, good! Rog is here!

120
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,215
-What's the matter with Rog?
-Nothing. It's a little thing.

121
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,176
I hate that guy!

122
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,288
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

123
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,335
Come on, he's not that bad.

124
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,211
That's where you're wrong!
Why would I marry her. . .

125
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,137
. . .if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

126
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,372
I don't know.

127
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,256
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

128
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,369
Why? Why would I?
Why?

129
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,012
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

130
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,574
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling.

131
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,973
Wait!
Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

132
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,778
Well, I don't know.

133
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,015
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage. . .

134
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,728
. . .so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

135
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:15,047
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

136
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,292
-So you think I'm a failure?
-Isn't he good?

137
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,653
That's not what I was saying.

138
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,814
I thought you were on my side. . .

139
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,288
. . .but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad. . .

140
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,567
. . .so they'd favor you.

141
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:32,087
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

142
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:37,973
You're right.

143
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,571
I mean, you're right!

144
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,407
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace. . .

145
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,174
. . .and the Weeble's Cruise Ship. . .

146
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:52,172
. . .which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

147
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,090
That's tough, tough stuff.

148
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,575
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

149
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,373
Feel better, okay?

150
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,375
We're gonna be late, sweetie.

151
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,216
Thanks for everything, Mon.

152
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,288
No problem.

153
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,330
It was great seeing you again.

154
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:12,691
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

155
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,974
Remember, they're just food. . .

156
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,537
. . .they're not love.

157
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,371
I hate that guy!

158
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,132
Good night, you guys.

159
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,572
Oh, look!
It's the woman we ordered.

160
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,727
Can we help you?

161
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,086
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

162
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:44,891
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

163
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,571
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

164
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:49,767
Oh, my God!

165
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,538
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

166
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,530
I'm Ronni.

167
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,607
Cheese nip?

168
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:04,969
Joey's having an embolism. . .

169
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,772
. . .but I'd go for a nip.

170
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:16,493
Most people,
when their pets pass on. . .

171
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,298
. . .want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

172
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,535
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

173
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:25,378
Like chasing their tail.

174
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,209
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

175
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:33,575
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

176
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,851
That's a good one!

177
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,537
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

178
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,017
Hello, babe!

179
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,053
What are you doing here?

180
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:48,891
You left your hair
at my place.

181
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,413
I thought you'd need it
for your meeting.

182
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,134
Thank you.

183
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,533
So! Who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

184
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:04,887
Look, I. . . .

185
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,691
I shouldn't have come.

186
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,247
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

187
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,449
I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

188
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,376
Where am I gonna stay?
Here?

189
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,532
We'll go to a hotel.

190
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,767
We'll go to a hotel.

191
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:22,169
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

192
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,177
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

193
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:28,211
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

194
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,010
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

195
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,014
Right, mister!

196
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,818
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here. . .

197
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,367
. . .you're gonna live by my rules.

198
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,611
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

199
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,772
Wow, he's strict.

200
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,407
Dad, you'll be in my room.

201
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,536
Ronni, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

202
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,048
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

203
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,214
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

204
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:00,572
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, ''No, thanks, it's late! ''

205
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,894
This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

206
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:10,527
-Six years is long enough!
-What kind of change?

207
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,655
-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!

208
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,412
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

209
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,532
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

210
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,571
Hey, kickie!

211
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:37,008
What are you doing?

212
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,577
Trying to get comfortable.

213
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,571
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

214
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,366
I've been thinking. . .

215
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,769
. . .about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls. . . .

216
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,769
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

217
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,216
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

218
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,177
I always figured, when
the right one comes along. . .

219
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:08,575
. . .I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance.

220
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:11,087
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking--

221
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,607
You're not him, you're you.

222
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,167
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

223
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:21,847
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

224
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,013
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

225
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:29,491
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along. . .

226
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:31,529
. . .you'll have the guts to say:

227
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,091
''No thanks, I'm married. ''

228
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,767
You really think so?

229
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,007
I really do.

230
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:44,771
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

231
00:13:58,378 --> 00:13:59,174
May I help you?

232
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:03,333
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

233
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:05,974
Who are you?

234
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:09,372
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

235
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,494
The mistress?

236
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,216
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

237
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,295
I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

238
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:18,408
Say, Ronni. . . .

239
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,774
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

240
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,697
Like five minutes.

241
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:24,973
Perfect.

242
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,611
Fasten your seat belts. . .

243
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,376
. . .it's pee-pee time!

244
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,366
Hey, Mr. Trib.

245
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,212
Good morning, dear.

246
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:44,766
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

247
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:59,329
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

248
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:03,088
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing!

249
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,377
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

250
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:16,774
How's it going?

251
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:17,894
Good.

252
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:22,291
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

253
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:26,454
What's going on?

254
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:27,767
Nothing.

255
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:29,567
It's just that. . . .

256
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:31,568
It's Roger.

257
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:34,452
There's something about--

258
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:36,810
Basically, we just feel
that he's. . . .

259
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:38,047
We hate that guy!

260
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,453
We hate him!

261
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,137
We're sorry, Pheebs.

262
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,015
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive. . .

263
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,816
. . .that it freaked you out?

264
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,736
-No, I hate him!
-No, we hate him!

265
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,053
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,410
Ma! What are you doing here?

267
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,574
I came to give you this. . .

268
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:09,012
. . .and this!

269
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,657
Big ring!

270
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,811
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage. . .

271
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,572
. . .about making things right?

272
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,968
Things were fine the way they were!

273
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,778
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

274
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:24,777
For God's sake, Joey!
Really.

275
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,616
Hold on. You knew?

276
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:31,093
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

277
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,613
Your father is no James Bond.

278
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,610
You should have heard
his cover stories.

279
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,008
''I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's. ''

280
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,408
I mean, what is that?
Please!

281
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:42,410
So then, how could you--?

282
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,007
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

283
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:49,297
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

284
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:53,087
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

285
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,771
Now he's happy.

286
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,486
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

287
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,175
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but. . .

288
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:05,011
. . .what the hell
are you saying?

289
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,491
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

290
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:11,412
Look, honey. . .

291
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,769
. . .in an ideal world. . .

292
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:17,095
. . .there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

293
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,970
And I'll tell you something else:

294
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,409
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along. . .

295
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:28,776
. . .he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

296
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,775
He's been more loving.

297
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,408
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

298
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,929
I'm happy for you. . .?

299
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,287
Well, don't be!

300
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,095
Because now everything's screwed up.

301
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:45,611
I just want it the way it was.

302
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,611
Ma, I'm sorry.

303
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:52,168
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

304
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:56,172
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

305
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,371
So tell me. . . .

306
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:02,767
Did you see her?

307
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:08,692
You're ten times prettier
than she is.

308
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,172
That's sweet.

309
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,132
Could I take her?

310
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,974
With this ring, no contest!

311
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,128
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing. . . .

312
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,776
What's wrong? Come on.

313
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,130
It's nothing. I'm fine.

314
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,215
It's just--
It's my friends.

315
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,018
They have a liking problem with you. . .

316
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:38,407
. . .in that. . .

317
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,977
. . .they don't.

318
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,573
They don't?

319
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:46,772
But you know. . .

320
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:49,691
. . .they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

321
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:53,294
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

322
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,017
They think you're a little. . . .

323
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:56,734
What?

324
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,087
Intense and creepy.

325
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,606
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

326
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,888
I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

327
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,407
You're not?
That's why you're so great.

328
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,814
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior. . .

329
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:18,051
. . .when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

330
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,772
You know, this kind of codependent. . .

331
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:22,576
. . .emotionally stunted. . .

332
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:27,773
. . .sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups. . .

333
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:31,215
. . .which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

334
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:36,896
And you're all like,
''Oh, define me! Define me!

335
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,771
Love me! I need love! ''

336
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:42,776
So you talked to your dad?

337
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,890
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

338
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,612
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know.

339
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:51,497
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore. . .

340
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,694
. . .because he got
a restraining order.

341
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:57,968
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

342
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,606
Things have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

343
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:04,813
So Joey, are you okay?

344
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,487
Yeah, I guess.

345
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,888
It's just--
You know, they're parents.

346
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:11,971
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

347
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,777
Even if you know better. . .

348
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:16,367
. . .you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

349
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:17,567
And just think. . .

350
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,814
. . .in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

351
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,377
Oh, please!

352
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,576
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond. . .

353
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:27,212
. . .chasing after 20-year-old boys. . .

354
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,176
. . .or I'll end up like my mom!

355
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:36,566
How's it going?

356
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,933
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

357
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:42,888
Yeah, right!

358
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,614
What happened?

359
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:50,373
I don't know. I mean. . . .

360
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,011
He's a good person. . .

361
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:54,055
. . .and he can be really sweet.

362
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:57,411
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

363
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:58,613
It's just. . . .

364
00:20:58,858 --> 00:20:59,973
I hate that guy!

365
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:10,613
What's going on?

366
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,372
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

367
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:15,336
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

368
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,693
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

369
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:26,373
Sorry, wrong boobies!

370
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:40,127
Hello, Joey!

371
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,767
Hello, dear!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

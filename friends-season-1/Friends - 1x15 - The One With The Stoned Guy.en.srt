00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,536
Coffee.

2
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:07,017
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:11,179
And a nice hot cider for Monica.

4
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,490
Thank you.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,097
Rach?

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,015
Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,340
That's why.

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,694
Sorry.

9
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,131
The One With the Stoned Guy

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

11
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:22,849
Chandler?

12
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,171
Miss Tedlock, you're looking
lovely today.

13
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,811
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

14
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:35,694
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

15
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,970
If this is about those prank memos,
I had nothing to do with them.

16
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,018
Nothing at all. Really.

17
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,337
Nothing.

18
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,454
Hey, you guys! You guys!

19
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:51,374
Chandler's coming and he says
he has incredible news.

20
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:54,931
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know--

21
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,340
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

22
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,574
What's going on?

23
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,381
So it's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers. . .

24
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:08,331
. . .and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

25
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:10,572
-That is great!
-Congratulations!

26
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,856
So. . .

27
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,937
. . .I quit.

28
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,740
Why?

29
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,977
Why? This was supposed to be
a temp job.

30
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,940
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

31
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,174
I know, but if I took it, it would
be admitting that this is what I do.

32
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,570
Was it a lot more money?

33
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,734
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office. . .

34
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,533
. . .worrying about the WENUS.

35
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,175
''The WENUS?''

36
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,056
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

37
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,578
Oh, that WENUS.

38
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,136
What are you gonna do?

39
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,377
I don't know. That's the thing.

40
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,617
But I won't figure it out
working there.

41
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,977
I have something you can do!

42
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,291
I have this new massage client, Steve.

43
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,541
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant. . .

44
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,136
. . .and he's looking for a head chef.

45
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,850
Hi, there.

46
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,057
I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

47
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:13,134
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so. . . .

48
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,894
I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

49
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,053
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

50
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,018
What kind of food
is he looking for?

51
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,940
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone. . .

52
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,137
. . .who can create the entire menu.

53
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,933
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, I know!

54
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,819
So what do you think?

55
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,458
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big white hat.

56
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,054
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

57
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,097
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

58
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,733
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

59
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,534
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

60
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:07,332
I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

61
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,694
I added the ''a-go-go. ''

62
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,170
Career counselor?

63
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:15,174
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

64
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,649
I don't.

65
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,737
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

66
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,137
You know, you have goals,
you have dreams.

67
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,530
I don't have a dream!

68
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,932
The lesser known
''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

69
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,255
Oh, I love my life! I love my life!

70
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,934
Brian 's Song!

71
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,129
The meeting went great?

72
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,054
So great! He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

73
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:43,178
It's this cute little place on 1 0th.

74
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,094
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

75
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:49,532
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

76
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,657
Anyway, I'm cooking for him
Monday night. Kind of an audition.

77
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,779
He wants you to be here,
which will be great for me.

78
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,295
You can make yummy noises.

79
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:00,612
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

80
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:04,772
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

81
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,376
I don't know.
It's just got to be great.

82
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,771
I know what you can make!
I know!

83
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,694
You should make that thing
with the stuff.

84
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,257
You know. . .

85
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,492
. . .that thing with the stuff?

86
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,375
Okay, I don't know.

87
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,530
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

88
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:29,493
How about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

89
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,332
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

90
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,932
-Who are you going out with?
-Is this the bug lady?

91
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,218
I love you, Ross.

92
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,859
Her name's Celia.
She's not a bug lady.

93
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,376
She's curator of insects
at the museum.

94
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,090
What are you gonna do?

95
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:55,732
I thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place. . .

96
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:58,330
. . .and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

97
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,538
He's not speaking metaphorically.

98
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,375
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe. . . .

99
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,973
Well, I don't know. . . .

100
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,295
I'm hoping. . . .

101
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,137
I tell you, that monkey's
a chick magnet.

102
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:24,653
She's gonna look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

103
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,341
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

104
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:31,333
Soothing tones, soothing tones.

105
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,093
Here, here.
You want some?

106
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,140
I can't stand this.

107
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,939
He's got his claws on my--

108
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,494
Yeah, all right.

109
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,737
Try this salmon mousse.

110
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,337
Good.

111
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,930
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

112
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:57,736
It's creamier.

113
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:00,297
Yeah? Well, is that better?

114
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,811
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

115
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,010
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

116
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,293
God, what happened to you?

117
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,334
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests. . .

118
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,659
. . .intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

119
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:26,852
''You're suited for data processing for
a large multi national corporation. ''

120
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:31,332
That's so great because you
already know how to do that!

121
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,659
Can you believe it?

122
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:37,137
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something really cool?

123
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:41,169
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something. . . .

124
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,570
Something!

125
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,733
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

126
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:49,293
You can see your nipples
through this shirt.

127
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,491
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

128
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:00,539
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

129
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,534
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

130
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:07,539
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

131
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,572
Well, it is amusing.

132
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,650
Oh, hi, Wendy.

133
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,449
Yeah, 8:00.

134
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,820
What did we say, $ 1 0 an hour?

135
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,336
Okay, great.

136
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,577
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

137
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,214
Ten dollars an hour for what?

138
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:34,850
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

139
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,570
Waitressing?

140
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,893
Of course I thought of you.

141
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,936
But. . . .

142
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:45,257
But. . . .

143
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,297
But, but. . . .

144
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:52,572
But, you see, it's just this thing
has to go just perfect, you know. . .

145
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:56,655
. . .and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

146
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:03,572
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

147
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:11,492
You know, I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '7 6.

148
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:16,980
Amuse-bouche?

149
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:35,174
Talk to me.

150
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,534
A weird thing happened to me
on the train this morning--

151
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:44,853
Talk dirty.

152
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,460
-Here?
-Come on.

153
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:52,736
Come on.

154
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,420
Say something. . .

155
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,180
. . .hot!

156
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,696
What?

157
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,330
What?

158
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,970
What?

159
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,290
What?

160
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,134
-What?
-Vulva.

161
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:15,570
''Vulva?''

162
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:19,737
All right, I panicked, all right?

163
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,653
She took me by surprise.

164
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:25,570
But it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, we ended up cuddling.

165
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,540
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

166
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,613
Shut up. It was nice.

167
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,133
I just don't think I'm
the dirty-talking kind of guy.

168
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:37,571
Just say what you want to do to her.

169
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,777
Or what you want her to do to you.

170
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:43,138
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

171
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:46,573
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

172
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,534
Please be kidding.

173
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:54,136
Why not? Come on.

174
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:58,010
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

175
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,018
I'm in my apartment. . . .

176
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:08,857
Yeah, what else?

177
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,700
You're not there.
We're not having this conversation!

178
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,012
-All right. I'll start.
-Joey, please.

179
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,371
Come on, come on.
All right, ready?

180
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,295
Oh, Ross. . .

181
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,334
. . .you get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

182
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,011
See?

183
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,729
Now you say something.

184
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,579
I really don't think so.

185
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:33,856
Come on.

186
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,654
You like this woman?

187
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,175
-You wanna see her again?
-Sure.

188
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,254
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

189
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,890
Now tell me you want
to caress my butt!

190
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay, turn around.

191
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,930
I don't want you staring at me
while I do this.

192
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,735
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

193
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:56,976
Okay.

194
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,051
I want--

195
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,337
Okay, I want. . .

196
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,730
. . .to feel. . .

197
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,700
. . .your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

198
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,330
There you go.

199
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,134
Keep going, keep going.

200
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,137
I want to take my tongue and--

201
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:29,696
Say it.

202
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,050
Say it!

203
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,373
--run it all over your body. . .

204
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,376
. . .until you're trembling with--

205
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,936
With?

206
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,412
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

207
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,855
It's okay. It's okay.

208
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,138
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

209
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:16,014
While you were sleeping, that guy
from your old job called again.

210
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,171
Again?

211
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,334
-And again and again and again.
-And again.

212
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,097
And again!

213
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:31,050
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

214
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,733
Yeah, I miss you too.

215
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,536
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

216
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:40,930
That's very generous.

217
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,537
But look, this isn't about the money.

218
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,138
I need something more than a job.
I need something I really care about--

219
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:51,334
That's on top of the year-end
bonus structure?

220
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,809
-Your dream!
-Your dream!

221
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,337
Look, Al. Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

222
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:59,379
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

223
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:02,980
Stop saying numbers!

224
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,531
I'm telling you, you've got
the wrong guy! You got the wrong guy!

225
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,214
I'll see you Monday!

226
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:23,737
Wow! It's huge!

227
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,933
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

228
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:29,097
This is a cube!

229
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:30,650
Look at this.

230
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,139
You have a window!

231
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,729
Yes, indeedy.

232
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:43,133
-With a beautiful view of--
-Oh, look! That guy's peeing!

233
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:47,493
Okay. That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

234
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,939
Okay, sit down here. Sit down.

235
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,336
This is great. This is great.

236
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,095
You ready?

237
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:57,451
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

238
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,135
Thank you, that'll be all.

239
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,452
Last time I do that.
I promise.

240
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,539
Wendy, we had a deal.

241
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,373
Yeah, you promised.

242
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,775
Who was that?

243
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,095
Wendy bailed.

244
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:30,939
I have no waitress.

245
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,452
That's too bad.

246
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:35,737
Bye-bye.

247
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:38,934
-Ten dollars an hour!
-Nope.

248
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:40,370
$ 1 2 an hour.

249
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,972
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

250
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:48,259
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there for you.

251
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,210
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you. . . .

252
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:54,699
Twenty dollars an hour.

253
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:56,976
Done.

254
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:07,136
Well, hello! Welcome to Monica's!
May I take your coat?

255
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,412
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

256
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,339
Hello, greeter girl.

257
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,292
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

258
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,737
Everything smells so delicious.

259
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:26,059
I can't remember a time I smelled
such a delicious combination of--

260
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,495
Okay, smells.

261
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,972
It's a lovely apartment.

262
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,132
Thank you. Would you like a tour?

263
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,941
I was just being polite,
but all right.

264
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,056
What's up?

265
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:44,260
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

266
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:46,417
What?

267
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:50,332
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

268
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:54,572
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech.

269
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,292
Is it dry in here?

270
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,537
Let me get you some wine.

271
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,255
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

272
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:11,331
These are rock shrimp ravioli. . .

273
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,651
. . .in a cilantro ponzu sauce. . .

274
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,131
. . .with just a touch of minced. . .

275
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,336
. . .ginger.

276
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,456
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

277
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,534
These are fantastic!

278
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:33,215
Oh, gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

279
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,617
Like them? I couId eat 100 of them!

280
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:40,857
That's all there is of these. . .

281
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,252
. . .but in about 8 1 /2 minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

282
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:46,140
''Tartlets?''

283
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,020
''Tartlets. ''

284
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,454
''Tartlets. ''

285
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,298
Word has lost all meaning.

286
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:03,140
Excuse me. Can I help you
with anything?

287
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,736
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

288
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,014
Oh, cool! Taco shells!

289
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,932
These are-- They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

290
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,575
You don't want to spoil your appetite.

291
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:33,809
Sugar-O's!

292
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:37,332
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

293
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,617
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

294
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,300
No, we don't.

295
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:50,416
Sorry.

296
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,931
Why don't you just have a seat here?

297
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:03,696
Give me the Gummy Bears.

298
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,057
Give them to me.

299
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,171
We'll share.

300
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,611
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

301
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:13,731
Give them to me!

302
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,135
This is not working.

303
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,894
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

304
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,057
Hey, fellas! Grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

305
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:26,737
Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help!

306
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,014
That's it! Dinner is over!

307
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,137
-What?
-''What?''

308
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:32,814
-Why?
-''Why?''

309
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,211
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this. . .

310
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:38,572
. . .and you can't even wait
4 1/2 minutes for a tartlet?

311
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,090
What a tool.

312
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,736
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

313
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,974
I know. It's just I just thought
that this was, you know, ''it. ''

314
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,939
You'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

315
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,775
You know those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

316
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,971
So how did it go with Celia?

317
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,332
I was unbelievable.

318
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,940
All right, Ross!

319
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,340
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

320
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,856
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

321
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:27,252
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines. . .

322
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:29,174
. . .themes, a motif.

323
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:32,015
At one point, there were villagers.

324
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:34,691
And. . . .

325
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,538
Well, by the time we finished
with all the dirty talk. . .

326
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,215
. . .it was late and we were
both exhausted, so. . . .

327
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:44,929
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

328
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,935
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

329
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,179
Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

330
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,619
Whoa! Where the hell is he?

331
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,978
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is. . .

332
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,338
. . .but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

333
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,252
Oh, really?
Let me tell you something.

334
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:05,938
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

335
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:22,256
How's this?

336
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,216
Sorry. How about over here?

337
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:27,139
That just means it's working.

338
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:29,337
Does this hurt?

339
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,339
How about this?

340
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,494
There you go!

341
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,410
Oh, the throb!



9999

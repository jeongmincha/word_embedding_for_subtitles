1
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,056
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:08,856
We have EarI Grey, EngIish Breakfast,
cinnamon stick. . .

00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:12,650
. . .chamomiIe, Mint MedIey,
bIackberry and. . . .

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,461
Wait, there's one more. . . .
Lemon Soother!

5
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,213
You're not the guy that asked
for the tea, are you?

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,492
The One Where the Monkey Gets Away

7
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,730
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

8
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,055
Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

9
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:16,819
Thank you.

10
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:21,098
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

11
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:24,054
Oh, good, because
where else would we get any?

12
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,419
Oh, right.

13
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,970
Great.

14
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,290
What is it?

15
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,253
Country club newsletter.

16
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:38,052
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

17
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,209
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,612
Oh, my God!
It's Barry and Mindy!

19
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,613
-Barry, who you almost--?
-Barry, who I almost--

20
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,334
-And Mindy, your maid of--
-Mindy, my maid of--

21
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,009
Let me see.
That's Mindy?

22
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:50,336
Wow! She is pretty.

23
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,816
Lucky. . .

24
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,735
. . .to have had a friend like you.

25
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,854
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice.

26
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:06,733
Good boy.
Give me the rice.

27
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,539
Thank you. Good boy.

28
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,699
He's mastered the difference
between ''bring me the'' . . .

29
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,619
. . .and ''pee in the. ''

30
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,020
''Bring me the'' and--
Rach?

31
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:22,614
Oh, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,139
This is so stupid!

33
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,417
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

34
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,612
I should be happy for them.

35
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,459
I am. I'm happy for them.

36
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,414
Really?

37
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:38,337
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

38
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,894
Whoa, what. . . .

39
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:44,059
What happened to
''Forget relationships!

40
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:47,611
I'm done with men''?
The whole penis embargo?

41
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,330
I don't know.

42
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,333
I guess it's not about ''no guys. ''

43
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,651
It's about the ''right guy,''
you know?

44
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,697
With Barry. . .

45
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,893
. . .it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

46
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,132
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

47
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,858
And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual--

48
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,012
Right, right! I got it.

49
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,015
I was there.

50
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,011
But do you think
you can ever have both?

51
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,217
Someone that's your best friend. . .

52
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,770
. . .but then also can make
your toes curl.

53
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,615
Yes, I do. I really do.

54
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,058
In fact, it's funny.

55
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:30,059
Often, someone who
you wouldn't think could. . .

56
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,453
. . .curl your toes. . .

57
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:34,936
. . .might just be the one who--

58
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,660
--gets interrupted.

59
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,459
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

60
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,253
-Wonderful!
-It was so good!

61
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,214
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

62
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:50,652
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with, like, guns and bombs. . .

63
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:53,011
. . .and buses going really fast!

64
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,815
I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie. . .

65
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,621
. . .as long as
there's a little nudity.

66
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:01,731
There was nudity.

67
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,135
I meant female nudity.

68
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,935
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

69
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,692
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

70
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,612
All right, I've got to go.

71
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,174
Come on, Marcel.
Come on!

72
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,010
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

73
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,810
They're still just friends, right?

74
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,531
And I will see you tomorrow.

75
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:30,659
Right. You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

76
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,580
Hang on. Does Aunt Monica
get a say in this?

77
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,536
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

78
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,618
Oh, unclench.
You won't even be here.

79
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,456
I can't believe
we're having this discussion.

80
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,818
I agree.
I'm, like, in disbelief.

81
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,019
If it was gonna happen
with Rachel. . .

82
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,694
. . .wouldn't it
have happened already?

83
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:57,210
She said she's looking
for a relationship. . .

84
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,173
. . .with someone exactly like me.

85
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,610
She said that?

86
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:03,251
Well, I added
the ''exactly like me'' part.

87
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,617
But she said
she's looking for someone.

88
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,698
And someone will be there tonight.

89
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,136
''Tonight'' tonight?

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,055
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

91
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,418
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

92
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:22,217
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

93
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:30,374
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine. . .

94
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,971
. . .go over there
and try to woo her.

95
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,094
You know what you should do?

96
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:40,452
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

97
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,460
If you keep this up...

98
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,010
... you'll be finished
by the weekend.

99
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,333
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

100
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,811
Now, she used to be a man.

101
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,580
Look. See, there's Raven.

102
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,373
We hate her.

103
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,253
We're glad she's dying.

104
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,810
And then--
What? Marcel!

105
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:06,610
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to--

106
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:12,293
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

107
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,334
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

108
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,219
Oh, God!

109
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,218
Sorry, Barry.

110
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,777
A little engagement gift.

111
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,575
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

112
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:38,812
Who died? Who died?

113
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,895
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

114
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:47,179
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because--

115
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,370
Marcel?

116
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,051
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

117
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:57,737
We were watching TV,
then he pooped in Monica's shoe. . . .

118
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,734
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

119
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:01,976
I don't know.

120
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,734
The left one!

121
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:04,931
Which ones?

122
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,975
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

123
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,375
Why is the air in here so negative?

124
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,453
Rachel lost Marcel.

125
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:19,497
Oh, no! How?

126
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,811
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

127
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,211
Those cute black ones
I wear all the time.

128
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:25,974
No, which one?

129
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,379
The right or left?

130
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,372
Because the left one is lucky.

131
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,214
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

132
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,139
All right.
You're a monkey. . .

133
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,019
. . .you're loose in the city.

134
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,779
Where do you go?

135
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:43,090
It's his first time out, so he'll
do some of the touristy things.

136
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:49,610
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

137
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:52,861
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

138
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,410
He'll be home any minute.
He'll kill me!

139
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,016
Search the building.
You take the first and second floor.

140
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,740
We'll take third and fourth.

141
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:01,260
What am I gonna do?

142
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,770
You stay here
and just wait by the phone.

143
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:07,178
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

144
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,612
Does anybody want to trade?

145
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:17,897
What do you want?

146
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,777
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

147
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,178
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

148
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,618
Why'd you leave it in the hall?

149
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,490
I wasn't ready for it.

150
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,892
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

151
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,859
I saw Regis Philbin once.

152
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,493
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

153
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,259
You owe me a waffle.

154
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,411
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face. . .

155
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,779
. . .with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

156
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:51,770
Thanks.

157
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:54,689
How did it go today?

158
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,813
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

159
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,295
Is that wine?

160
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,295
You want some?

161
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,339
Oh, I would love some.

162
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,811
But you know what?
Let's not drink it here.

163
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:08,376
I feel crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

164
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:18,014
We could. But before we go to
the murder capital of the Northeast. . .

165
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,853
. . .I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

166
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,615
You know how we
were talking before. . .

167
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,452
. . .about relationships and stuff. . . .

168
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,614
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

169
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:41,210
Oh, God!

170
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,175
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

171
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,816
Please don't hate me.

172
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:47,776
What? What?

173
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,299
You know Marcel?

174
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:59,057
I kind of lost him.

175
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,293
I can't believe this.

176
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,135
All I asked you to do was
keep him in the apartment!

177
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:20,456
I know. I'm sorry.

178
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,458
I guess it's partially my fault.

179
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:25,374
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

180
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,811
I should have started you off
with a pencil.

181
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,619
I'm doing everything I can.

182
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:33,619
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got--

183
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,653
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

184
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:41,177
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

185
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,370
Why? Do you not like them?

186
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:53,100
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

187
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,420
I'm not allowed to have him.

188
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:01,011
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

189
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,812
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

190
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,051
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

191
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,540
Hi! Thanks for coming.

192
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,612
Somebody called about a monkey?

193
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:21,337
You know what? That was
a complete misunderstanding.

194
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,850
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

195
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,057
-It turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

196
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,695
We checked the third floor.
No one's seen Marcel.

197
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:31,970
My uncle Marcel.

198
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,570
Is that who the monkey's named after?

199
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,172
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable. . .

200
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,413
. . .by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

201
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,650
Oh, my God!

202
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,656
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

203
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:56,612
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

204
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,610
Yes, but there isn't always time.

205
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:07,417
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

206
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,856
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

207
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,809
Oh, my God, you are!

208
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,494
And you're Rachel Greene!

209
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,655
Luisa Gianetti!
Lincoln High?

210
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:22,218
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

211
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,859
Luisa! Oh, my God!

212
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,097
Monica! It's Luisa!

213
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,212
Luisa! From homeroom!

214
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,060
You have no idea who I am, do you?

215
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:36,859
Not at all.

216
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,975
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

217
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,619
Would it have been so hard to say,
''Morning, Luisa'' . . .

218
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,817
. . .or ''Nice overalls''?

219
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,540
Oh, I'm so sorry!

220
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:58,019
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

221
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,896
But you. What a bitch!

222
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:04,890
What?

223
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,410
You know what?
Be that as it may.

224
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,654
Could you help us out here on that
monkey thing for old times' sake?

225
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,613
Go, Bobcats!

226
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,214
I could. But I won't.

227
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,219
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

228
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,291
Sorry.

229
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,616
Marcel?

230
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,210
Marcel?

231
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,819
Hi, can I help you?

232
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,935
We're kind of having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

233
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,610
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

234
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:57,421
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

235
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,259
Can you fix radiators?

236
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:02,692
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

237
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:04,057
Of course!

238
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,013
Oh. Then, no.

239
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:12,056
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum?

240
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,656
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

241
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,459
Oh, no, wait!

242
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,210
We may not know
about radiators, per se. . .

243
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:24,937
. . .but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

244
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,811
Weren't we in the middle
of something?

245
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:34,178
But these women are very hot
and they need our help.

246
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:36,979
And they're very hot!

247
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,259
We can't, all right?

248
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,854
We're sorry.

249
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:46,810
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised to find this monkey.

250
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,013
He's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

251
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,577
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

252
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,973
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

253
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:14,530
-Oh, my God!
-What?!

254
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,579
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

255
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,015
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

256
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:23,891
Look, Phoebe!

257
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,657
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

258
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,300
Step aside, ladies.

259
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,859
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a small tranquilizer.

260
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,052
Run, Marcel! Run, Marcel!

261
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,217
Damn!

262
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:52,291
Are you okay?

263
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,651
I think so.

264
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:03,617
Oh, gosh!

265
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,657
We've been all
over the neighborhood!

266
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,334
He's gone!
He's just gone!

267
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:21,539
-You don't know that.
-Come on! It's cold, it's dark.

268
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,817
He doesn't know the Village!

269
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:26,451
And now I have a broken foot.
Oh, my--

270
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,931
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

271
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,330
Thank you very much!

272
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:33,254
I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

273
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,093
What do you want me to do?

274
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,859
You want me to break my foot too?

275
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:38,972
Here, I'll break my foot right now.

276
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:42,491
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

277
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:45,818
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign. . .

278
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:49,220
. . .I don't miss Marcel anymore!

279
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,695
It's not like
I did this on purpose.

280
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,051
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

281
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,610
Things just sort of happen around you!

282
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:02,052
You're off in ''Rachel Land,''
doing your ''Rachel Thing'' . . .

283
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:07,056
. . .oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and--

284
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,134
I don't even want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

285
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,414
What? What?

286
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,412
Hey, banana man!

287
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,140
Oh, this is so intense!

288
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:30,216
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

289
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,416
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

290
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:39,016
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

291
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,216
I don't have a monkey.

292
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,135
-Then what's with all the bananas?
-Potassium.

293
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,013
Okay, where is he?
Where is he?

294
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:57,810
What have you done to him?

295
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,336
That's my monkey.
That's Patty the monkey.

296
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,814
Are you insane?

297
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,818
Come here, Marcel.

298
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,136
Come here, Patty.

299
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,774
Come here, Marcel.

300
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,137
Come here, Patty.

301
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,212
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

302
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:14,816
Gotcha!

303
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,615
-Give me my monkey back!
-That's my monkey.

304
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,738
Take this up with the judge.

305
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,977
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

306
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,058
You can send it back whenever.

307
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,259
All right, I want my monkey!

308
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,179
Oh, come on, Luisa.

309
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:30,370
Sorry, prom queen.

310
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:33,698
You had to be a bitch in school,
you couldn't have been fat.

311
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,251
In high school,
I was the prom queen. . .

312
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:41,811
. . .and the homecoming queen
and the class president and you. . .

313
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,972
. . .were also there.

314
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,058
If you take this monkey, I'll lose. . .

315
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,980
. . .one of the most
important people in my life.

316
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:52,776
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

317
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:56,018
Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

318
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,097
Take it!

319
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,820
Then I'll call your supervisor
and tell her. . .

320
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,774
. . .you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart!

321
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,421
It'll be nice
to get this off, won't it?

322
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,414
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

323
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:26,376
With the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

324
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,410
Listen. . . .

325
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,535
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before--

326
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,733
No, come on. It was my fault.
I almost lost your--

327
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:41,490
But you got him back.
You were great.

328
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:49,016
We still have that bottle of wine.

329
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,610
Are you in the mood for. . .

330
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:52,930
. . .something grape?

331
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:56,258
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

332
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:09,018
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

333
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:17,012
Well, as long as we're. . .

334
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,415
. . .here. . .

335
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,818
. . .and not on the subject. . . .

336
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,217
I was thinking about. . .

337
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,379
. . .how mad we got
at each other before.

338
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,331
And I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we--

339
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,658
-Rachel?
-Barry?

340
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,171
I can't. I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

341
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:46,578
I'm still in love with you.

342
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:55,017
We have got to start
locking that door!

343
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:07,654
This is me in The Sound of Music.
You see the von Trapp kids?

344
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,773
Because I'm in front of them.

345
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,611
I thought that was an alp.

346
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:15,098
High school was not
my favorite time.

347
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:17,212
I don't know.
I loved high school.

348
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:21,130
It was just like four years
of parties and dating and sex and--

349
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:24,533
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

350
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:27,898
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

351
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:33,215
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

352
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,618
My butt cheek is waking up!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

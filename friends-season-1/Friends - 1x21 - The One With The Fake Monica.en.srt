1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,106
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:07,658
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:11,458
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:14,269
Still, it's just
such reckless spending.

5
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:16,300
When somebody steals
your credit card. . .

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,347
. . .they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,259
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:29,863
That's me.

9
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,662
He's doing it again!

10
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,905
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

11
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,379
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

12
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:42,584
Come here, Marcel!

13
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,059
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'II get him.

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,064
You've got to do something
about the humping.

15
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:50,260
What? It's just a phase.

16
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:53,177
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

17
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,507
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

18
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,899
Marcel, stop it! Marcel!
Bad monkey!

19
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,384
What?

20
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,185
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

21
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,625
The One With the Fake Monica

22
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:13,898
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,107
Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

24
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,943
-This woman's living my life.
-What?

25
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,859
She's Living my Life,
and she's doing it better than me.

26
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,266
Look at this. Look.

27
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,899
She buys tickets to plays
I want to see.

28
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,341
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

29
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:17,109
She spent $300 on art supplies.

30
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:18,458
You're not an artist.

31
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,269
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

32
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,348
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

33
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,258
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

34
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,505
Oh, really?
Let's compare, shall we?

35
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:34,661
Oh, it's so late for ''shall we. ''

36
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,785
Do I go horseback riding
in the park?

37
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,662
Do I take classes at The New School?

38
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:43,868
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,306
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,465
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:59,228
No, still too ethnic.

42
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,467
My agent thinks I should have
a name that's more neutral.

43
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:03,545
Joey Switzerland?

44
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,501
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm. . .

45
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,784
. . .this big.

46
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,098
Which I'm not!

47
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,746
Joe, Joe, Joe. . . .
Stalin?

48
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,743
Stalin.

49
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,298
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

50
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,263
Well, it does not
ring a bell with me.

51
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:33,458
Joe Stalin.

52
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,061
You know, that's pretty good.

53
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,665
You might want to try Joseph.

54
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,467
Joseph Stalin!

55
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:51,865
-I think you'd remember that!
-Oh, yes!

56
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,143
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

57
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,659
Joseph Stalin is
The Fiddler on the Roof!.

58
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,863
Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

59
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,744
I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

60
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:22,342
What are you doing?

61
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:23,858
AII right, great.

62
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,582
Great. Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,861
I'm going to tap class.

64
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,061
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

65
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,504
She's got my Life.
I want to see who she is.

66
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,866
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

67
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,865
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

68
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,583
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

69
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,746
This is madness, I tell you.

70
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,861
For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it!

71
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:51,578
Thank you.

72
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,503
What do you think?

73
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,303
Lots of things.

74
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,547
Which one do you think she is?

75
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:07,307
-May I help you?
-No, thanks.

76
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:09,107
We're just here to observe.

77
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,058
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

78
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,265
Spare shoes are over there.

79
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:18,903
What does she mean?

80
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,940
I think she means, ''You dance. . .

81
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:22,628
. . .a dance class! ''

82
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,547
Come on, come on, come on!

83
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,659
Really?

84
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,103
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

85
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,865
People, last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

86
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,747
Let's not have that happen again!

87
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,061
She could be you.

88
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,824
Let's get started.

89
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:47,746
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

90
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,581
Okay, I'm not getting this!

91
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,299
I'm totally getting it!

92
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:05,298
Do you ever just feel Like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

93
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,865
What? You just click
when they click.

94
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,018
AII right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

95
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:25,624
AII right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

96
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,577
Great, it's gym class all over again.

97
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,418
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

98
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:38,459
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

99
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,980
It's okay, it's okay! I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm Late.

100
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,298
Okay, here I am.

101
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,938
So who's the new tense girl?

102
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:53,498
She's your partner.

103
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,421
Hi, I'm Monica.

104
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,387
Hi, I'm Mon--

105
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,385
Nana.

106
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:04,823
Monana.

107
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:07,784
It's Dutch.

108
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:11,226
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

109
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,740
Pennsylvania Dutch.

110
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:19,382
And we're dancing!

111
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,745
Five, six, seven, eight.

112
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,741
-Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

113
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,259
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

114
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,261
She says Marcel’s humping
thing is not a phase.

115
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,501
Apparently, he's reached
sexual maturity.

116
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,459
Hey, he beat you!

117
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,859
She says, as time goes on, he'll
start getting aggressive and violent.

118
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:02,424
What does this mean?

119
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,102
I have to give him up.

120
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:25,548
I can't believe it. This sucks!

121
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,099
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

122
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,307
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing. . .

123
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,228
. . .and before you know it,
he's this Little thing. . .

124
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,465
. . .I can't get off my leg.

125
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,499
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

126
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,701
The vet said that
unless he's in a place. . .

127
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,264
. . .where he has regular access. . .

128
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,065
. . .to some monkey loving. . .

129
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,060
. . .he's just gonna get vicious.

130
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,869
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

131
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,348
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know that one!

132
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,467
No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.

133
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,301
We're applying to a Lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

134
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,858
You know, Like San Diego.

135
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:17,625
Right?

136
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,422
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

137
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,747
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

138
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,299
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

139
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:39,903
We found the girl!

140
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,468
-What?
-Did you call the cops?

141
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,142
Nope. We took her to lunch.

142
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,949
Your own brand of vigilante justice.

143
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,221
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

144
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,784
She stole!
She's a stealer!

145
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,463
After you're with this woman
for 1 0 minutes, you forget all that.

146
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,864
I mean, she's this
astounding person. . .

147
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,065
. . .with this amazing spirit!

148
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,261
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

149
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,699
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Volkswagen!

150
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,781
I Love that joke.

151
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:23,865
-No way! No way did you do this!
-Monana was very brave.

152
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,858
It was so wild.

153
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,867
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 61 5. . .

154
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:32,658
. . .only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

155
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,179
So when they caught on that
we were short and have breasts. . . .

156
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,145
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

157
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,307
Go, Monana!

158
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,905
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones Living the dream.

159
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,700
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

160
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:55,983
Oh, by the way. . .

161
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:59,266
. . .tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

162
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,585
Excuse me?

163
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,501
There's an open call for Cats.

164
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:06,343
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing ''Memories'' . . .

165
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,258
. . .and make complete fools
of ourselves. What do you say?

166
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,024
Remember who you're dealing with here.

167
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:18,187
I'm not Like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

168
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,340
That's because of
your Amish background.

169
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,260
You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

170
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,458
Right.

171
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,741
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunt.

172
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:33,102
I was just Like you.

173
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,024
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my Life.

174
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,938
Did you ever see
Dead Poet's Society?

175
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,818
I thought that movie was
so incredibly. . .

176
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:44,825
. . .boring!

177
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:48,063
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid. . .

178
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,869
. . .kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

179
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,104
What was that?

180
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:56,706
It's Like, ''Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater! ''

181
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,462
As I walked out, I thought. . .

182
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:04,947
. . . ''Now that's two hours of my Life
that I'm never getting back! ''

183
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:09,342
And that scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do!

184
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:13,861
Wow. Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

185
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,697
Oh, God.

186
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,584
We didn't get into Scranton.

187
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:30,268
That was our safety zoo.

188
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,141
They take, Like, dogs and cows.

189
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,980
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

190
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:44,502
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

191
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,782
Good boy!

192
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,060
See? How can nobody want him?

193
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,941
Somebody will.

194
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:02,383
You know, there already is
a Joseph Stalin?

195
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:08,498
You're kidding!

196
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:14,784
Apparently, he was a Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

197
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,866
-You'd think you would’ve known that!
-You'd think I would’ve.

198
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,388
Phoebe, what do you think a good
stage name for me would be?

199
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:28,542
Flame Boy!

200
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,501
Where exactly is your zoo?

201
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:40,309
Well, it's technically
not a zoo per se.

202
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:44,462
It's more of an interactive-
wildlife experience.

203
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,661
Let me ask you some questions about--
Is it Marcel?

204
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,098
Does he fight with other animals?

205
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,265
No, no. He's very docile.

206
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,583
Even if he were cornered?

207
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,784
Well, I don't know. Why?

208
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,941
How is he at handling small objects?

209
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,663
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

210
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,622
What about a hammer
or a small blade?

211
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,744
Why would he need a blade?

212
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,901
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns. . .

213
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,709
. . .you've got to give
the Little guy something.

214
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,467
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

215
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,339
He got into San Diego!

216
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:32,465
What?

217
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,019
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing. . . .

218
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:37,139
He's in!

219
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,462
Did you hear that, Marcel?

220
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,507
It's San Diego! San Diego!

221
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,542
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good. . .

222
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,099
. . .but if you give him to me, I'II
start him against a blind rabbit. . .

223
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,061
. . .and give you 20% of the gate.

224
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,658
Where have you been?

225
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,067
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

226
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,977
Are you drunk?

227
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:19,424
No!

228
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:25,338
I'm Lying.

229
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:27,705
I am so drunk!

230
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:28,978
Oh, God!

231
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,818
Great. You know what?
You could have called.

232
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,265
I've been up here.
I've been worried--

233
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,306
Water rules!

234
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,260
Yes. Yes, it does.

235
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:51,422
The restaurant called. They want
to know if you're showing up.

236
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,864
Nope!

237
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,499
I'm going to the
Big Apple Circus today.

238
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:59,498
What are you doing? You're gonna
lose your job. This is not you!

239
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,421
No, it is me!

240
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,661
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows. . .

241
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:07,025
. . .and pay the bills
as soon as they come in!

242
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:11,859
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

243
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,387
I'm Monana!

244
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,544
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second, please.

245
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,740
Monana, it's for you.

246
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:31,226
The credit card people.

247
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,388
Oh, my God!

248
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:41,818
Thanks.

249
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:43,865
What?

250
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,785
They've arrested Monica.

251
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:01,228
How are you?

252
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,863
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue’s my color.

253
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:07,265
How did you know I was here?

254
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,737
Because. . .

255
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,860
. . .I'm Monica Geller.

256
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:15,943
It was my credit card you were using.

257
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,425
That I was not expecting.

258
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,064
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

259
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,828
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

260
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,504
You have given me so much.

261
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,705
Without you,
I'd have never gotten. . .

262
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:33,298
. . .to sing ''Memories''
at the Wintergarden Theater.

263
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:35,540
Actually, you only got
to sing ''Memo--''

264
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,578
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

265
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,258
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

266
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,539
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

267
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,381
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women. . .

268
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:55,668
. . .and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

269
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,379
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

270
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,859
There's nothing to wonder about.

271
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,658
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

272
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,459
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

273
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:12,377
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

274
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,261
I'm not actually Amish.

275
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:20,858
Really?
Then why are you Like that?

276
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,862
You by the door, in or out?

277
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,745
In!

278
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,146
You in the back,
you're getting it wrong!

279
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,141
At least I'm doing it!

280
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,058
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67 to San Diego...

281
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,379
...boarding at gate 42A.

282
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,785
Okay, goodbye, Little monkey guy.

283
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,020
AII right, I wrote you this poem.

284
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,022
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

285
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,981
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

286
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,826
Okay, bye, champ.

287
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:30,068
There's gonna be a Lot
of babes in San Diego. . .

288
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,187
. . .but remember,
there's also a Lot to learn.

289
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,466
I don't know what to say.
It's a monkey.

290
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,258
Just say what you feel.

291
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:48,622
Marcel, I'm hungry.

292
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,505
That was good.

293
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,859
Marcel, this is for you.

294
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,820
It's just, you know, something. . .

295
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,466
. . .to do on the plane.

296
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,141
If you don't mind, I'd Like
a moment, just me and him.

297
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:10,857
-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.

298
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,025
Marcel, come here.
Come here.

299
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:19,705
Come here.

300
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:21,862
Well, buddy. . .

301
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,268
. . .this is it.

302
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:28,462
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

303
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,064
I'm really gonna miss you.

304
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,461
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

305
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,058
You've been more than. . .

306
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,867
. . .just a pet to me.

307
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,465
You've been more Like a--

308
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,865
Would you leave my Leg alone?

309
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,061
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds?

310
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,946
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

311
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:20,908
O, that I were a glove upon
that hand that I might. . .

312
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,901
. . .touch thy cheek!

313
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,703
That's fine. Thank you.
